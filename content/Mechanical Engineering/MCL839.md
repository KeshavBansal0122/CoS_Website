**Credits:** 3 (2-0-2)

#### Description
Distinction between rigid and flexible rotors, vibration response to steady state and transient excitations, bending critical speeds and response to unbalance for simple and complex rotor bearing system, orbital analysis and cascade plots, critical speed map, Campbell diagram. Disc gyro-scopics, synchronous and nonsynchronous whirl, review of fluid film bearings and seals, analysis of rotors mounted on hydrodynamic bear-ings, two spool and multispool rotors, asymmetric rotors, bent rotors, etc. Parametric excitations including that in rolling element bearings, instabili-ties due to fluid film forces and hysterisis, influence of nonlinear sup-ports, seals and bearings on rotor dynamic response. Instability in rotor bearing systems, sources of instability and basic ap-proaches to avoid instability conditions Balancing techniques, such as rigid rotor balancing, modal balancing, etc. Introduction to smart rotor systems. Use of finite element based ap-proach for solving rotor dynamic problems. Application of vibration based condition monitorings, signal processing for rotor fault identification, application of expert systems for automated condition monitoring, remote monitoring and other commercial systems. The course involves extensive coding in Matlab for dynamic response analysis of a general rotor bearing system. The course involves experi-mentation on Machinery Fault Simulator.
