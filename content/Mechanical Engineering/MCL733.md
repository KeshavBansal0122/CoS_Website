Elements of vibration analysis: modeling practical systems through discrete system/lumped parameters approach and its subsequent analysis for different types of excitations encountered in practice. Alternate mathematical models of damping, two and multi-DOF systems, tuned mass dampers. Introduction to vibration isolation: displacement/force isolation, approaches for MDOF system analysis with emphasis on modal approach. Numerical and Continuum Analysis: Finite Element Method for dynamic analysis. Distributed parameter models of rods, bars, beams, membranes and plates. Introduction to Modal testing, Vibration Testing. Spatial, Modal and Response models of vibrating systems. Non-linear and Random vibrations: Introduction to non-linear vibrations, response to random excitation. Engineering acoustics: Wave approach to sound, wave equation, Noise measurement and instrumentation standards. Sound pressure, power and intensity and its measurement, Sound Intensity, Various Sound Fields, Concept of Monopoles, Dipoles and Quadrupoles, Sound Power measurement, Transmission loss, Design of partitions, barriers, acoustic enclosures, Design of Mufflers; Sound Absorbing Materials, Noise Control approaches, case studies.
