#### Description
Overview of IE methods and tools such as decision making under uncertainty (Pay-off tables, decision trees, utility theory etc.), Probability based methods for outcome prediction (Logistic regression, Bayesian belief networks, Monte Carlo simulation etc.), Multicriteria decision making (AHP, ANP, Graph theory etc.), System Simulation (through games like the Beer game for supply chain), Queuing theory games, Economic analysis (NPV, IRR etc. for deterministic and stochastic scenarios), Algorithms (branch and bound, Metaheuristics etc.), Formulation of bigger optimization problems and solving using available solvers (eg. CPLEX). Shop-floor scheduling.
