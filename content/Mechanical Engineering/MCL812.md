#### Description
Introduction - importance of combustion. Chemical thermodynamics and chemical kinetics. Important chemical mechanisms. Coupling chemical and thermal analysis of reacting systems. Premixed systems: detonation and deflagration, laminar flames, burning velocity, flammability limits, quenching and ignition. Turbulent premixed flames. Non-premixed systems: laminar diffusion flame jet, droplet burning. Combustion of solids: drying, devolatilization and char combustion. Practical aspects of coal combustion, woodstove combustion.
