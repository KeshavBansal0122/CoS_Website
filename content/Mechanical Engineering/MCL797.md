    title: MCL797 Freedom and Constraints in Design
---
**Credits:** 3 (3-0-3)



**Prerequisites:** For UG: [[/AML140 | AML140]] and [[/Mechanical Engineering/MCL111 | MCL111]]; For Non-ME PG: [[/Mechanical Engineering/MCL799 | MCL799]]

#### Description 
The course contents will include lecture & hands-on-experience covering: Degrees-of-Freedom and constraints, exact-constrained design; design of elastic mechanisms/flexures/complaint mechanisms; constraint and mobility analysis using screw algebra; design for stiffness; friction and hysteresis; actuators and sensors for robotic application. The course contents also include different case studies and then working on different course projects identified by the students.
