title: "MCP401 Mechanical Engineering Laboratory-II"
---
**Credits:** 2 (0-0-4)

**Prerequisites:** [[/Mechanical Engineering/MCL211|MCL211]], [[/Mechanical Engineering/MCL212|MCL212]], [[/Mechanical Engineering/MCL242|MCL242]], [[/Mechanical Engineering/MCP301|MCP301]]

#### Description
The experiments would involve full or partial fabrication of setups and then taking readings and analysis of its behavior, instead of using ready made setups. The knowledge gained in control engineering course would also be used for setting up computerised measurements using Data acquisition cards.
