#### Description
Conceptualization of a machine in terms of geometrical requirements specified in terms of functional degrees of freedom, degrees of constraints and stiffness. Synthesis of an assembly from machine components to meet the functional requirements. Sizing machine components and selecting material through use of free body diagrams, failure theories in static and repeated loading. Design and selection of certain machine elements (i.e. cams, gears, belt- pulleys, bearings, springs, shaft / axle, plates, nuts and bolts, brake/ clutch) as exemplars. Case studies (like Gearbox driven by motor using belt drive) through use of parametric software to carry out iteration in the design space.
