**Credits:** 4 (3-0-2)



#### Description 
Review of machine element design based on strength and distortion criterion; review of choice of materials and their treatment: Designing for fatigue, creep; Design criterion for fracture; Application of advanced design criterion to machine elements (like shafts, spur / bevel / worm gears); Design of structures, machines and equipment; Classical methods of unconstrained optimization (single variable and multi variable), classical methods of constrained optimization, Numerical optimisation techniques including i. genetic algorithms, (binary and real coded) ii. Simulated annealing. Case studies of Optimum Design (Gear Box, Power Transmission, shape and topology using FE).
