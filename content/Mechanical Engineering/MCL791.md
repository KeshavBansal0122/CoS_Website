**Credits:** 4 (3-0-2)



#### Description 
Introduction to matrix materials - polymers, metals and ceramics. Introduction to reinforcements – fibers, flakes, particulates: macro, micro and nano. Hand layup, tape layup, autoclave moulding, vacuum bag moulding, compression moulding, resin transfer moulding, reaction injection moulding, filament winding, pultrusion, braiding, and other manufacturing variants. Macromechanics of a lamina as a building block of a composite structure, stress-strain relation, strain –stress relation for anisotropic material, orthotropic materials, material property matrix estimation, micromechanics of a lamina, effect of fiber volume fraction on properties, failure theories of a lamina. Laminate analysis, failure of a laminate, design principles of tailor made material systems.
