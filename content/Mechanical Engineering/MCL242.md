#### Description 
Modes of heat transfer, energy carriers and continuum approximation.

Mechanisms of mass transfer. Unified view of momentum, heat and mass transfer.

Conduction: Fourierâ€™s law, heat diffusion equation, 1-D steady state conduction in extended surfaces, heat generation, lumped capacitance and 1D transient models, semi-infinite wall. Diffusion mass transfer in 1D: steady state and transient.

Convection: Forced and free convection - mass, momentum and energy conservation equations, scaling analysis and significance of non-dimensional numbers, thermal boundary layers, heat transfer in external and internal laminar and turbulent flows, and use of correlations. Convective mass transfer. Boiling and condensation: physical phenomena and correlations.

Heat exchanger types and analysis: LMTD and effectiveness-NTU method. Radiation: properties, Laws, view factor, 3-surface network for diffuse- gray surfaces. Gas radiation.
