**Credits:** 4 (3-0-2)

#### Description
Introduction to surface engineering â€“ importance and scope of surface engineering, conventional surface engineering practices like pickling, grinding, buffing etc., surface engineering by material addition like electroplating, surface modification of ferrous and non-ferrous materials like nitriding, cyaniding, aluminizing etc.

Advanced surface engineering practices like laser assisted surface modification, electron beam assisted modification, spraying techniques like flame and plasma spraying, high velocity oxyfuel, cold spray techniques.

Sputter deposition processes, PVD and CVD methods of surface coatings, surface modification by ion implantation and ion beam mixing. Characterisation of the engineered surface and coatings like thickness, porosity and adhesion of coatings, surface microscopy and spectroscopic analysis of the modified surfaces.

Functional coatings and their applications.
