Department: Department of Mechanical Engineering

Prerequisites: [[/Mechanical Engineering/MCL733 | MCL733]]

Basic principles of environmental noise: Definition, basic attributes of sound (wavelength, period, frequency velocity, speed, pressure, power and sound intensity), units (decibel, dB(A) and SPL), Wave analysis of structures and spaces. Environmental noise propagation: Sources, distance from source, atmospheric absorption, wind, temperature, wind and temperature gradient, obstacles such as barriers and buildings, ground absorption, reflections, humidity. Perception and of effects of noise: Human ear & hearing damage, measures of hearing, loudness, phones, noise descriptors. WHO guidelines for community noise: speech masking, activity interference, noise and sleep, noise annoyance. Noise measurements and instrumentation: Noise measurement and control instrumentation, Leq and various noise metrics for road, railway, aircraft and industrial noises. Various types of acoustic testing chambers. Source identification, Sound Intensity Mapping. Noise Control: Importance of reverberations time. Design of absorption systems for required reverberation time. Noise isolation design. Noise absorber design. Vibration Control Strategies: Design of Isolators in machine foundations.
