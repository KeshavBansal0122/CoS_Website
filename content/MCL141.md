Overview and the importance of the knowledge of thermal science in manufacturing processes. Basics of thermodynamics: closed and open systems, work and heat. First law of thermodynamics for control mass and control volume. Second law of thermodynamics. Irreversibilities and examples of irreversibilities in manufacturing.

Introduction to transport phenomena : various modes of transport of momentum, energy and mass- diffusion and advective transport. Convective heat and mass transfer - Concept of momentum, thermal and concentration boundary layers; relevant correlations. Radiation heat transfer. Blackbody radiation. Gray and diffuse surfaces. Surface radiation. Case studies of manufacturing processes involving application of the above concepts.
