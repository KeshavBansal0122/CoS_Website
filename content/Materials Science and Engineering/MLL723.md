#### Description 
Molecular weight and molecular dimensions by end-group analysis, osmometry, light scattering, viscometry, gel permeation chromatography, mass spectrometry, FT-IR and NMR spectroscopic techniques. Thermal properties by differential scanning calorimetry, differential thermal analysis, thermogravimetry. Polarized light optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction on polymers; crystallinity by density measurements.
