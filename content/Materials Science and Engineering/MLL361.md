#### Description 
Introduction to production of Iron and Steel: Early history of iron and steel, evolution of iron and steel making technology, iron and steel making in India, overview of blast furnace iron making and modern steel making, sponge iron making, smelting reduction processes, general physiochemical fundamentals, present status of world steel industry, general layout of integrated steel plants, raw materials for steel making, steel making refractories.

Classification of furnaces; different kinds of furnaces; heat balance, energy conservation and energy audit; parts, construction and design aspects of blast furnace, ancillary equipment; blast furnace instrumentation; Blast furnace reactions; Grunerâ€™s theorem, carbon deposition, the partitioning of solute elements between the Iron and the slag; reactions in blast furnace; blast furnace slags; mass balance and heat balance.

Blast furnace (B/F) operations: B/F irregularities and remedial measures, B/F refractories and causes of failure, modern trends in (B/F) technology overview of direct reduction processes, electric smelting; production of DRI (HBI/Sponge iron).

Alternate Iron Making Processes: Sponge iron making -coal -based and gas -based, smelting reduction processes-fundamentals, catagorisation, salient features of Corex, Hismelt, Finex, Fastmet, ITmk3 processes, Mini-blast furnace.

Review of traditional steel making; physical chemistry and thermodynamics; air/O2 impurity interaction, slag metal interaction, role of slags in refining, continuous casting; foaming slag; removal of S and P; de-oxidizers, alloying; Open hearth F/C and operation; Bessemer converters; bottom blown and top blown processes; slag practices and sequencing; LD, VD, AOD, and VOD; Ladle metallurgy; electric arc furnace and DRI usage; energy, environmental and quality considerations.
