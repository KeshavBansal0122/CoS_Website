    title: SPL721 Perspectives on Climate Change- Implications for Policy
---
**Credits:** 3 (3-0-0)



#### Description 
The course will develop a basic understanding of science of climate change, the associated uncertainties and the processes that link this science with policymaking. The impacts of climate change on socio-economic and natural systems and the link between climate change, and development policies will be discussed. The global distribution of greenhouse gas emissions and possible technological, market and regulatory trajectories to mitigate them will be discussed with the emphasis on how different trajectories lead to questions on geographic, inter-generational and distributional equity. The students would examine economic, political and institutional frameworks for understanding policies and practices designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, vulnerability to climate change and facilitate adaptation in the face of climate threats and explore how policy can produce or reduce vulnerability. The course will draw on theoretical framings and methodological tools from multiple disciplines including atmospheric sciences, economics, environmental policy, psychology and sociology.
