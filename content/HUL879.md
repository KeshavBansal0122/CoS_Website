Department: Department of Humanities and Social Sciences

Questions of conflict over natural resources, the conservation of biodiversity under market environmentalism, the political ecology of farming and industry, the emergence of environmental movements, the political ecology of indigenous people, feminist political ecology, urban ecology, environmental justice, and degrowth comprise core concerns of this course. The influence of globalization and neo- liberalism provides a rich context to understand these contestations and conflict over resource distribution. These propel the debates on ecological utopias. Case Studies include (any two per semester): forestry; industry and mining; body and health; climate change; water; political ecology of tribal areas of India.
