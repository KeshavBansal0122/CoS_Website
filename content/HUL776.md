What is capitalism and how did it emerge? What are its strengths and weaknesses? How have the social scientists analysed it and understood its implications for and relationship with other social phenomena? Addressing these questions, this course discusses the historical development of capitalist institutions and social relations in the context of the advanced industrial and developing societies. Particularly, it analyses the various theories and paradigms of capitalistic development, such as the Marxist political economy, classical liberalism, world systems theory, economic history and neo- liberalism. Furthermore, it analyses the relationship between the state and market, capitalism and liberal democracy, the religious roots of capitalism, social embeddedness of economic activity, and the ‘new realities’ of capitalism, such as displacement, inequality and rampant environmental degradation.
