Introduction to biology: protein structure, composition, pKa and isoelectric point. Governing equations applied to biological systems: conservation laws, flux equations, mathematical functions and solutions, scaling and order, laminar flow. Electromechanical transport: biomolecular migration through blood capillaries, Poisson-Boltzmann equation in heterogeneous media, electrical-shear stress balance in electrical double layers. Transport across membranes: structure and self-assembly of lipid bilayers, ligand-receptor interactions, membrane permeability, Nernst potential, adsorption isotherms and transport across membrane. Estimation of transport coefficients based on biomolecular interactions. Research-specific case studies incorporating coupled migration through reactive, electrical and heterogeneity considerations.
