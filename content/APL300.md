Concept of continuum; introduction to stress, strain and rate of strain tensors; Principal stress and strains; Equation of equilibrium/ motion in solid and fluid mechanics; lagrangian and eulerian view point; constitutive equations in the context of both solids and fluids; System of simultaneous linear and non-linear equations: how they arise in mechanics; Determination of constitute curves; interpolation techniques; Application of numerical integration and differentiation to axial vibration of bars and beams; solution techniques for boundary value problems arising in bending of beams, one dimensional fluid flows and boundary layer equations; stability analysis â€“ computation of eigenvalues; Direct and indirect methods of solution of linear equations; Emphasis will be on using the finite difference method (FDM) to solve problems in solid and fluid mechanics.
