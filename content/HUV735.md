The course will acquaint students with the distinctions of formal and conversational, fictional and non-fictional narratives. Students will acquire the training to think about and conduct research on discourse by going beyond the story and plot and considering discourses in terms of salient narrative features such as narration, author, reception, motivation, tradition, and framing. The politics of culture, representation and the working of power can be better analysed with a mind to the role of narrative in action, communication and signification.
