Basic Soil Models: Single parameter model - Winkler; Two parameter models - Filonenko-Borodick, Pasternak; Elastic Continuum - plane strain, plane stress, Boussinesqâ€™s problem, line load, strip load; Special models starting with elastic continuum - Vlazov, Reissner; Three parameter model - Kerr model; Evaluation of model parameters for different conditions. Beam on Winkler foundation: solutions for infinite and semi-infinite beams; Finite beams: method of initial parameters, method of superposition. Beams on Elastic continuum: Use of finite difference method, rigid and flexible beams, lift-off, non-homogeneous soil, non-linear soil, plastic yielding of soil. Raft or Mat foundations: thin rectangular plates, approximate theory of plates, circular plates. Pile on Winkler foundation: Vertically loaded pile - rigid pile, evaluation of spring stiffness, non-homogeneous soil, compressible pile; Laterally loaded pile - rigid pile, Elastic pile, standard solutions for different end conditions; Pile on elastic continuum : vertically loaded piles - rigid pile.
