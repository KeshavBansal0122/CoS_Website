**Prerequisites:** [[/Physics/PYL115 | PYL115]]

#### Description 
Signals and systems, Fourier transform (FT), FT theorems, sampling theorem, Space-bandwidth product; Review of diffraction theory: Fresnel-Kirchhoff formulation, Fresnel and Fraunhofer Diffraction and angular spectrum method, FT properties of lenses and image formation by a lens; Frequency response of a diffraction-limited system under coherent and incoherent illumination. Basics of holography, in-line and off-axis holography, plane and volume holograms, diffraction efficiency; Recording medium for holograms; Applications of holography: display, microscopy; memories, interferometry, NDT of engineering objects, Digital Holography etc.; Holographic optical elements. Analog optical information processing: Abbe-Porter experiment, phase contrast microscopy and other simple applications; Coherent image processing: vander Lugt filter; joint- transform correlator; pattern recognition, image restoration.
