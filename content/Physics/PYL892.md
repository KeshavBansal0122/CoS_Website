Sensors based on Bragg and Long period gratings in Fiber and integrated optical waveguides, Sensors based on modal interference: Applications in temperature, strain and refractive index sensing. Distributed Sensors based on Raman and Brillouin Scattering. Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) bio-sensors based on Krechman and Otto configurations, coupling with optical fiber modes, Grating coupled, Localised SPR, Plasmonic nanoparticles, interferometry. Signal processing, Noise factors in sensors and sensor networking.
