#### Description
Description of principles of flow phenomena : pipe and channel flow laminar flow, transition, turbulance; flow past an object; boundary layer, wake, separation, vortices, drag, convection in horizontal layers, transition from periodic to chaotic behaviour; equations of motion; dynamical scaling, sample viscous flows; inviscid flows. Flow in rotating fluids; hydrodynamic stability.
