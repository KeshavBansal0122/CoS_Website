Affine varieties: Coordinate rings, polynomial maps, coordinate changes, rational functions. Local Properties of plane curves: Multiple points, tangent lines, multiplicities and local rings, intersection number. Projective varieties: projective algebraic sets, projective plane curves, linear systems of curves, Bezout’s theorem, Max Noether’s fundamental theorem and its applications.
