Roots of nonlinear equation in one variable: Direct and iterative methods, order of convergence. Iterative methods for roots of nonlinear system of equations. Linear systems of equations: Direct and iterative methods, rate of convergence of iterative methods, Condition number and ill-conditioned systems. Interpolation: Lagrange, Newton divided difference formula, Newtonâ€™s interpolations, errors in interpolation. Approximation: least square and uniform approximations. Differentiation: differentiation using interpolation formulas. Integration using interpolation: Newton-Cotes formulas, Gauss quadrature rules. Ordinary differential equations: Taylor, Euler and Runge-Kutta methods. Implementation of these methods.
