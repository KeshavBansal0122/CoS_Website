Department: Department of Mechanical Engineering

Prerequisites: For UG: [[AML140]] and [[MCL111]]; For Non-ME PG: [[MCL799]]

The course contents will include lecture & hands-on-experience covering: Degrees-of-Freedom and constraints, exact-constrained design; design of elastic mechanisms/flexures/complaint mechanisms; constraint and mobility analysis using screw algebra; design for stiffness; friction and hysteresis; actuators and sensors for robotic application. The course contents also include different case studies and then working on different course projects identified by the students.
