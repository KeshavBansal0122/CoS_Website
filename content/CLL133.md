Powder characterization for size, shape, surface area and flowability and relation between them. Characterization techniques: light scattering, light extinction, sedimentation, ultrasonic methods. Powder storage: designing of silos, flow of powders, measurement of flow factors, analytical methods for flow problems in chutes, cyclones and silos, funnel and mass flow. Segregation of powder during flow through chutes and air-induced flows. Segregation during heap formation. Comminution equipment: selection and designing. Particle size control in grinding circuit analysis. Gas-solid separation equipment, application for pollution control.
