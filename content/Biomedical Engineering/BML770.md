---
**Credits:** 3 (3-0-0)



#### Description 
Overview and significance or biomechanics to lead a better life, challenges and opportunities, inventions/research. Orthopaedic components - bones, tendons, ligaments and cartilages -primary functions, material constituents (osteoclasts, osetoblasts, collagen, collagen fibrils), mechanical strength, building vs recuperation rate, force analysis. Cardiovascular components-arteries, veins, primary functions & flowrate, material constituents, mechanical strength, inflammation, life span vs. recuperation rate, force analysis. Biomaterials - Metals/alloys, polymers, ceramics, shape-memory alloys, composites and functionally graded materials. Basic Principles
- Force-Motion, Force-Time, Inertia, Range of Motion, Segmental Interaction, Balance, Cordination continuum, Projection & Spin. Force analysis of Joints at various kinetic states - Spine (running, climbing, stairs, running downhill etc), Knee (squatting, jumping, climbing stairs, kickingsoccer), shoulder (abduction, adduction, bowling, smashing - racquet sports), Elbow (tennis, golf) and Hip (during fall, running). Demonstrations - Characterization, fractures & ruptures, non-invasive analysis (MRI, CT scan).
