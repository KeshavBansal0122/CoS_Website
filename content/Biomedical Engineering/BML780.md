Department: Centre for Biomedical Engineering

The course is a hands-on study of physiological mathematical models through a computing environment. Course will be focused on developing proficiency using mathematics and computation to analyze various biomedical engineering problems. Particular attention will be given to forward models, such as ordinary differential equation- based models drawn from cell and systems' physiological processes. Examples include biochemical reaction networks, cellular homeostasis, glucose-insulin, and respiratory systems. All the skills will be taught in the class.
