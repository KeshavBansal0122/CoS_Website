Credits: 1 (0-0-2)

Department: Department of Textile and Fibre Engineering

Prerequisites: [[TXL212]]/[[TXL211]]

The laboratory experiments are planned to provide knowledge on fibre formation of selected synthetic polymers and the characterization of fibres/tapes produced. Melt-spinning, extrusion, wet spinning and dry-jet wet spinning techniques is used to produce fibres or tapes. The evaluation of structure through thermo-mechanical properties, polymer solution rheology and microscopic analysis of materials is carried out using established methods.
