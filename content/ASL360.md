Department: Centre for Atmospheric Sciences

This course is on the physical principles of the Earth’s atmosphere. The course will begin with the forces and energy governing the atmospheric flows and regulating the weather and climate of the planet. Physical processes such as atmospheric convection will be discussed in great detail. How the atmospheric flows transport mass, momentum, and energy in space will be described. The general features of the today’s atmosphere will be explained. Emphases will be given on the need and art of atmospheric modeling and future projection of the atmosphere for the next century. The course is very conceptual in nature with a strong research flavour, and will introduce undergraduate students to the art of research in context of the subject.
