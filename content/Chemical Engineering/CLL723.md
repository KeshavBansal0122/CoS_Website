#### Description 
Overview of fuel cells: low and high temperature fuel cells. Fuel cell thermodynamics – heat and work potentials, prediction of reversible voltage, fuel cell efficiency. Fuel cell reaction kinetics – electrode kinetics, overvoltages, exchange currents. Electrocatalysis - design, activation kinetics. Fuel cell charge and mass transport - transport in flow field, electrode and electrolyte. Fuel cell characterization- in- situ and ex-situ characterization techniques, I-V curve, application of voltammetry and frequency response analyses. Fuel cell modeling and system integration. Fuel cell diagnostics. Balance of plant. Different routes of hydrogen generation: electrolysis versus reforming for hydrogen production, solar hydrogen. Hydrogen storage and transportation, safety issues. Cost expectation and life cycle analysis.
