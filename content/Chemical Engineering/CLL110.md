#### Description
Vector and tensor analysis. Euler/Lagrangian viewpoint of momentum transport, stress tensor and Newtonâ€™s law of viscosity, shell momentum balances. Derivation of equations of change for isothermal, non- isothermal, and multicomponent systems. Solutions to 1D flow problems involving Newtonian or non-Newtonian fluids, friction factor. Mechanisms of energy transport, energy flux for conduction, convection and viscous dissipation, solutions to 1D conduction and convection problems. Mechanisms of mass transport, mass and molar diffusion fluxes, derivation and application of continuity equation to mass transfer in binary mixtures. Dimensional analysis of equations of change to solve higher dimensional transport problems. Unsteady- state momentum, heat, and mass transport.
