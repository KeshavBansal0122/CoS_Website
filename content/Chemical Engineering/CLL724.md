The course covers the concept of ecological balance and the contribution of industrial and human activities in the changes of the environmental quality. Ecological cycles. Concept of pollutants and regulatory measures for the maintenance of environmental quality. Air pollution sources and its dependence on the atmospheric factors, atmospheric stability and dispersion of pollutants. Control of emission of pollutants using multi-cyclone systems, electrostatic precipitators, bag filters, wet scrubbers for gas cleaning, adsorption by activated carbon etc. Water pollution, its causes and effects. Pollutants and its dispersion in water bodies to predict water quality through modeling. Concept of inorganic and organic wastes and definition of BOD and COD. Control of water pollution by primary treatment and biological treatment systems. Solid waste management systems. Hazardous waste treatment, disposal and storage in engineered landfill.
