Department: Department of Chemical Engineering

Prerequisites: [[/Chemical Engineering/CLL110 | CLL110]]

Review of fluid kinematics, conservation laws and constitutive equations. Solution methods for equations of change (e.g., unsteady fluid flow in bounded/unbounded geometries). Creeping flow and lubrication approximation. Surface tension driven flows and multiphase flows. Boundary layer theory. Unsteady heat and mass transport. Coupled transport processes-- forced convection heat and mass transport in confined/unconfined flows. Multicomponent energy and mass transport. Turbulence modeling.
