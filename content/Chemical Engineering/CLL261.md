**Overlaps with:** MCL212, ELL225, ELL205

#### Description
Introduction to automation, block diagrams; revision of Laplace transform. Modeling based on transfer function approach, open-loop systems: dynamic response of first order systems, first order systems in series, second order systems, and transportation lag. Feedback control: P, PI, PID controllers. Dynamic response of closed loop systems Linear stability analysis: Routh stability criterion, root locus diagrams. Frequency response: Bode diagrams, Nyquist diagrams, Bode and Nyquist stability criterion. Controller tuning: Zeigler- Nichols and Cohen-Coon methods. Introduction to advanced control: feedforward control, cascade control, dead time compensation, ratio control, internal model control.
