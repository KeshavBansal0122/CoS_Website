Introduction to rate equations, calculation of conversion in single reaction, kinetics of homogeneous reactions. Derivation of reactor design equations, analysis and sizing of reactors, data collection and plotting to determine rate constants. Reactor networks (series/ parallel), concepts of selectivity and yield, reaction mechanisms.

Temperature and pressure effects on reactions and reactor design, simultaneous material and energy balances, multiple steady-states. Residence time distributions in non ideal reactors.
