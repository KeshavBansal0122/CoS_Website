The course examines contemporary manifestations of the 'media-

event', the 'spectacle' and the fetishism of the image-object in determining the collective consciousness of our times. How are 'media-events' created? What is the role of the media (this includes mass media, advertisements, as well as social and digital media) in determining the nature of the 'self' and 'society.'? How do media-trials alter the manner in which we relate to issues of justice and fairness? What is the manifestation of social movements in a media-saturated age? How do we recalibrate our understanding of privacy and what does this do to the ways in which we can create ever-changing and newer 'selves'? These questions will be examined through case studies from South Asia and beyond.
