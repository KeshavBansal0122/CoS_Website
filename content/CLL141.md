Brief introduction to crystalline solids - metals and semiconductors, types of atomic bonding and lattices. Semi-crystalline materials - ceramics, polymers, copolymers, liquid crystals and surfactants. Amorphous and composite systems such as glass, fibers, granular materials, matrices and alloys. Role of materials selection in design, structure-property-processing-performance relationships. Materials characterization via experimental techniques. Special materials like biomaterials and zeolites.
