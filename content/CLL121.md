Review of conservation of energy, mass and introduction to work- energy conversions, and the concept of entropy. Application to closed and open systems, application in analysis of energy and efficiency of equipment. State and properties of pure fluids under different conditions and in flow through equipment. Use of equations of states, graphs, correlations and tables to estimate fluid properties, understanding the relationships between fluid properties and changes in properties. Equilibrium properties of pure materials and mixtures. Understanding the phase behaviour and phase transitions of pure fluids. Thermodynamic analysis of fluids in standard fixtures and equipment (piping fixtures, power plants, engines, refrigerators). Equilibrium behaviour of mixtures of fluids, the nature of interactions between various fluids and how interactions affect their properties and phase transitions. Introduction to separation processes based on difference in equilibrium thermodynamic properties. Introduction to reaction equilibria.
