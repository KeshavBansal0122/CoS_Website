**Credits:** 3 (3-0-0)

#### Description
Introduction to Monsoon, Monsoon systems across the globe (Indian Monsoon, East Asian monsoon, West African monsoon, South and North American monsoon), Physical principles that are driving the Indian monsoon system, Atmospheric circulation or dynamics associated with the Indian monsoon system, How teleconnections (climate variability in other parts of the world such as PDO, ENSO, etc.) could possibly influence the Indian monsoon system, Introduction to climate models for simulating and predicting the Indian monsoon system and its variability, Inter-annual to decadal variability of the monsoon system, Seasonal prediction of monsoon, Intra-seasonal variability of monsoon (Active and Break periods), Long term (multi- decadal to century scale) variability of monsoon, Tropical cyclones over the monsoon region, Changing monsoon under changing climate, Natural versus Anthropogenic climate change, Global warming and its causes, Evidences of global warming evidences (sea level rise, retreat of glaciers, surface temperature increase), Linkages between global warming and climate change, Observed climate change over the monsoon region, Assessing changing monsoon using models and observations, climate change and global warming implications for the future of monsoon, Challenges involved in forecasting the monsoon and its variability. Future directions in monsoon research.
