#### Description
Introduction to the boundary layer, definition and qualitative description of temporal evolution and vertical structure; Fourier series and turbulence spectra, Reynold’s averaging, interpreting variance/ covariance as turbulent kinetic energy and fluxes, tensors and Einstein summation notation; Prognostic equations for mean variables in a turbulent flow, simplifications; Prognostic equations for turbulent fluxes and variances; TKE equation, static and dynamic instability, Reynold’s number, Richardson number, Obukhov length, stability parameter relationships, closure problem in turbulent flow, first-order local closure; surface boundary conditions, surface momentum, energy and moisture budgets, fluxes at surface and entrainment zone, drag and Bowen ratio methods; surface layer Similarity Theory, Buckingham Pi method, applications to wind profiles; Stable and convective mixed layer phenomena including nocturnal jets, thermals, dust devils; boundary layer clouds, fair-weather cumulus, fog; geographically generated local circulations like slope and valley winds, sea/lake breeze, geographically modified flow, fetch, internal boundary layer.
