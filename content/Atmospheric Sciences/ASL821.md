Quasi-geostrophic motions in the atmosphere: circulation and vorticity; Ertel-Rossby invariants; Ertel’s potential vorticity conservation theorem; Kelvin and Bjerknesbaroclinic circulation theorem; quasi- geostrophic turbulence. Instabilities in the atmosphere: barotropic and baroclinic instability; symmetric instabilities. Quasi-geostrophic motions in equatorial region, heat-induced tropical circulations: monsoons, El Nino and Madden-Julian Oscillation. Waves in the atmosphere: Kelvin, Rossby and Poincaré waves, Lamb wave, internal gravity waves, vertically propagating waves, Rossby adjustment theory. Middle atmosphere dynamics: sudden atmospheric warming, QBO. General circulation of the atmosphere: analysis of surface pressure and associated wind circulation, upper-tropospheric (200hPa) circulation; scale analysis, formulation of the governing set of equations for a weather prediction model.
