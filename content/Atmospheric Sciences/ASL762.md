**Credits:** 3 (3-0-0)



#### Description 
State of matter near the air-sea interface, marine boundary layer, transfer properties between atmosphere and ocean, solar and terrestrial radiation, sea surface radiation budget, surface wind waves, air-sea interaction processes using examples of ENSO, hurricane, Indian monsoon, turbulent transfer near the interface, bubbles and spray, transport of trace gases across the interface; latent, sensible, and momentum fluxes in the surface boundary layer over the sea, bulk parameterizations, large-scale forcing by sea surface buoyancy fluxes, spatio-temporal variability of ocean surface fluxes with reference to Indian ocean.
