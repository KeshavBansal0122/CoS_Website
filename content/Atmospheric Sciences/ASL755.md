#### Description
Basics of satellite remote sensing: satellite orbits, sensor characteristics, view angle, passive and active remote sensing; atmospheric radiative transfer application in retrievals of geophysical parameters; aerosol remote sensing using ground-based (passive radiometer and lidar) and satellite platforms, retrieval algorithm, vertical distribution, application of aerosol products in climate studies; cloud remote sensing, cloud detection using multi-spectral technique, issues in cloud-masking, CO2 slice technique; trace gas retrievals; ocean colour remote sensing, SST retrieval, wind scatterometry, altimetry; microwave remote sensing: soil moisture retrieval, passive (brightness temperature) and active (radar) microwave remote sensing for precipitation, sounding, remote sensing of cryosphere; satellite meteorology for extreme weather events (e.g. cyclone, thunderstorms etc.); land-use/land-cover change; hydrological application using gravity anomaly from satellites.
