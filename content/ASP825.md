Introduction to the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model and parallel computing; Install WRF, NCL and associated libraries; Conduct test simulations for 2-d idealized cases such as flow over a hill, sea-breeze, etc., configure and conduct test simulations for a full 3-d real case, conduct numerical experiments by changing initial & boundary conditions and namelist parameters/flags; Understand WRF code structure and registry by adding new variables into different modules; Introduction to parameterizations in WRF, explore the science and the codes of a land surface scheme and a cumulus scheme, make simple modifications to the schemes, conduct numerical experiments with modified schemes.
