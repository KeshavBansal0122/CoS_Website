Major modes or patterns of climate variability on intraseasonal to interannual and decadal time scales. Well-known modes including Madden-Julian Oscillation, El Nino-Southern Oscillation, Pacific Decadal Oscillation, Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation, Indian Ocean Dipole, Monsoon, North Atlantic Oscillation, and Annular Modes (Arctic and Antarctic Oscillation) and their impacts on extreme weather and climate. The course will review climate mode/pattern dynamics, their teleconnection mechanisms and impacts on weather/climate such as droughts etc. Temporal behavior â€“including how these modes have changed in the past, and how anthropogenic climate change may affect future mode behavior). Discussion of predictability of climate modes/patterns on seasonal to interannual time scales. Detection and attribution of climate change.
