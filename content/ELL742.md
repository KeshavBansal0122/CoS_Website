This course is an introduction to the multi-disciplinary and rapidly growing area of MEMS. A MEMS design engineer requires knowledge of several domains â€“namely mechanical, electrical, fluidic and thermal, as well as knowledge of circuits and microfabrication techniques. This course will cover the fundamentals as applicable to MEMS, as well as several case studies to understand the design process.
