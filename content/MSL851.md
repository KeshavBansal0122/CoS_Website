This is an advanced strategy course that focuses on the role of strategic alliances and inter-firm networks in the overall strategic adaptation process of the firm. Inter-firm networks and strategic alliances have emerged as important strategic options for navigating survival and creating competitive advantage in times of high velocity turbulent environments characterized by pressures to master rapid technological developments, counteract new competitors and the never ending need to acquire and master new capabilities (technical and managerial). The course explores crucial success factors that distinguish successful from failing strategic alliances. The course utilizes case discussions supplemented with readings, lectures, and conceptual discussions.
