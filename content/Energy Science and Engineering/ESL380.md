#### Description 
Introduction and basic concepts (Atomic structure, Avagadro’s number, isotopes, isotones and isobars, Binding energy, Einstein’s mass-energy relation, radio activity and radioactive decay, cross- section, differential cross-section and reaction rates), Nuclear structure (Nuclear mass, Nuclear shell model, Single-Particle features, Collective states), Nuclear instability (alpha, beta and gamma decay), Nuclear Reactions (Energy spectra, Angular distributions, electron scattering nuclear scattering, direct reactions, compound nucleus reactions, heavy-ion reactions), Interaction of radiation and matter (Heavy charged particles, electron, gamma-rays and neutrons), Detectors and instrumentation (Gas detectors, Scintillation detectors, semiconductor detectors, neutron detectors), Biological effects of radiation (Direct-Indirect physical/chemical damage, dose/dose rate/dose distribution, damage to critical tissue, human exposure to radiation and risk assessment), Industrial and analytical applications (Industrial uses such as tracing, gauging, material modification, sterilization and food preservation, neutron activation analysis, particle induced X-ray emission, acceleration mass spectrometry), Nuclear medicine (Projection imaging, computed tomography [CT] positron emission tomography, magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] and radiation therapy), Nuclear safety (Risk assessment and monitoring, radioactive waste disposal methodology, Disaster management aspects), Power from Fission (Fission products and characteristics, thermal fission reactor, breeder reactor, Finite reactor, Reactor operation, Commercial thermal reactor [Early gas-cooled reactor. Advanced gas-cooled reactor (AGR), Pressurized water reactor (PWR), Boiling water reactor (BWR), Heavy water reactor (HWR) and recent advances]), Thermonuclear fusion (Scope of fusion for future, Q-values, reaction rates, Fusion Ignition, requirement of plasma, Reactors [Magnetic Confinement Fusion {MCF} and Inertial confinement fusion {ICF}], Current Status).
