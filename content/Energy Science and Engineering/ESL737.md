**Credits:** 3 (3-0-0)

#### Description
Introduction: Plasma based processing of materials.

Plasma Concepts: Plasma fluid equations, single particle motions, unmagnetized plasma dynamics, diffusion and resistivity, the DC sheath and probe diagnostics.

Basics of Plasma Chemistry: Chemical reactions and equilibrium, chemical kinetics, particle and energy balance in discharges.

Low Pressure Plasma Discharges: DC discharges, RF discharges - Capacitively and inductively coupled, microwave, ECR and helicon discharges.

Low Pressure Materials Processing Applications: Etching for VLSI, film deposition, surface modification and other applications (plasma nitriding, plasma ion implantation, biomedical and tribological applications).

High Pressure Plasmas: High pressure non-equilibrium plasmas, thermal plasmas – the plasma arc, the plasma as a heat source, the plasma as chemical catalyst.

Applications of High Pressure Plasmas: Air pollution control, plasma pyrolysis and waste removal, plasma based metallurgy – ore enrichment, applications in ceramics, plasma assisted recycling.
