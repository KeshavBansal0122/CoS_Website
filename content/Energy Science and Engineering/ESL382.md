#### Description
Plasma Sources: Introductory concepts; Physics of high voltage sheaths; Particle and energy balance; Basic concepts of DC sources, RF sources (capacitively-coupled, inductively-coupled, helicon), microwave sources, resonance heated sources (electron cyclotron, ion cyclotron etc.).

Plasma Diagnostics: In-situ probes: Lang-muir probes, Capacitive probes, E-probes and other particle analysers; Essential plasma spectroscopy measurements; Plasma imaging methods; Interferometry and reflectometry; Electromagnetic emission diagnostics; Underlying principle of other advanced optical diagnostics (Thomson scattering, Laser Induced Fluorescence (LIF), Laser Photo Detachment (LPD)).
