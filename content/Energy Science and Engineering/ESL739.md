#### Description
Introduction to bioenergy; biomass harvesting; availability and assessment of biomass for bioenergy applications; characterization of biomass feedstock (physico-chemical properties, ultimate, proximate, compositional, calorific value, thermogravimetric, differential thermal and ash fusion temperature analyses); classification of biomass feedstock: first, second and third generation biofuels; hybrid biofuels, basic principles of chemical thermodynamics; carbon neutral fuels.

Different pre-treatment processes of biomass; different production routes for biomass conversion to biofuels: biochemical methods (anaerobic, enzymatic- saccharification and fermentation process, and dark fermentation, ABE fermentation); chemical processes (trans-esterification, hydro-processing, micro-emulsification); thermochemical methods (combustion, gasification, pyrolysis, partial oxidation, auto-thermal reforming) for biofuels production including synthesis gas, bio-hydrogen, ethanol, butanol, biogas, methanol, dimethyl ether and paraffinic fuels; Biomass compaction (briquetting and palletisation); biofuel quality upgradation; and biomass and biofuel fuel quality norms.

Biomass based incineration plant for heat generation; co-firing of biomass for heat generation for industrial processes; Biomass fuelled combustion devices for cooking and heating applications; Utilization of biomass in external combustion engines including steam turbine power plant and Stirling engines; Case studies for setting up biomass based small power plant (~ 1MW) capacity for rural electrification; utilization of biofuels in gas turbine, internal combustion engines and fuel cells; analysis of carbon neutral and carbon Credit.
