Introduction to waves and tides, Ocean waves: formation, characterisations, wave climate, energy content (Relations of ocean currents and waves with the driving forces- wave dynamics), resources and measurement, energy absorption, mechanical energy conversion, rotating and linear generators. Wave power technologies: oscillating wave columns (OWC) and point-absorbers (PA). Basics of sloshing dynamics (Fluid structure Interaction), Offshore structures â€“ buoys, mooring and anchoring design, tension leg platforms, umbilical cable etc., FLNG, System design aspects- Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC), tidal energy harnessing by basin design- sluice and estuary design. Marine energy harnessing technology, Transmission lines, History, legal aspects, environmental assets, biological effects, conflicts of interest, availability and re-sources.
