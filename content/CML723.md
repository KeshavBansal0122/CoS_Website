Fundamentals of FT NMR spectroscopy, relation between structure and NMR properties, one-dimensional spectroscopy (1H, 13C, DEPT, steady state NOE, saturation transfer) and an introduction to two-dimensional NMR (COSY, NOESY, and HSQC) and their use in structure elucidation. Principles and analytical applications of optical spectroscopic methods including atomic absorption and emission, UV-Visible, IR absorption, scattering, and luminescence.
