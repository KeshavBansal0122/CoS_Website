Axioms, Euler angles, equations of motion, kinematics and dynamics of constrained rigid bodies. Free vibration response of single-degree- of-freedom (SDOF) systems, undamped and damped vibration. Forced response of SDOF system, response to periodic excitation, impulse response, response to arbitrary excitation, convolution integral, and shock spectrum. Two degrees-of-freedom systems, orthogonality of modes, harmonic response, vibration absorbers. Multi-degrees-of- freedom (MDOF) systems, modal analysis. Continuous systems, axial vibration of rods, bending vibration of beams torsional vibration of rods, Rayleigh-Ritz method, symmetric and antisymmetric modes. Time domain and frequency domain analyses. Numerical methods- extraction of eigenvalues and eigenvectors, time integration techniques.
