#### Description 
Common electroactive microorganisms (shewanella, Geobacter, weak electricigens); Microbial extracellular electron transfer (direct electron transfer, mediated electron transfer using soluble electron shuttles, microbial nanowires); Electrolytes in bioelectrochemical experiments (electrolytes as microbial growth medium, ion transport in electrolytes); Bio-electrodes (biofilm formation, role of planktonic electroactive community members, electrochemical features of the interface); Basics of electrochemical cells (electrode potenitial, thermodynamics, kinetics, overpotential, half-cell reactions, combining two half-cells, three-electrode set-ups); Characterisation of live electroactive microbial cultures using voltammetry, chronoamperometry, chronocoulometry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy; Microbial fuel cells (power production, wastewater treatment, scale-up issues, common calculations, configurations and materials); microbial electrolysis cells (hydrogen and commodity chemical production); electrofermentation; bioelectrochemical sensors.
