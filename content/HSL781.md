Introduce students to critical perspectives on the potential and perils of digital welfare. The sectors it has disrupted, its contribution, its fallouts. The course will look at the role of big data and data mining in the rise of the digital economy. Using big data and data mining as a lens, the effort is to think harder, and understand better, the connections between the economy, technology, welfare, society, corporations and democracy.
