Introduction: Historical developments, Material properties; Cracked concrete members under flexural moment and axial force; Deformations and collapse; M-P interaction. Beams without stirrups under flexural and torsional shear: Morsch and Regan theories; Skew- bending theory. Beams with stirrups under flexural and torsional shear: Plane and space truss analogies, Modified compression field theory, Unified theory, P-M-V-T interaction; Strut and tie model; Cracking: Bond slip, Development length, Tension stiffening, Durability detailing; Serviceability: Elastic, creep and shrinkage deformations; Elastic analysis: Redistribution of moments; Plastic analysis: Inelastic and hysteretic behaviour, Limit design, Confined concrete: Ductility detailing requirements; Buckling of columns; Concrete slabs: Yield line theory, Strip Theory; Reliability and safety: Limit state design method, Target reliability; Current trends: Constitutive modelling, Capacity design, Finite element analysis.
