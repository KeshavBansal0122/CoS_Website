This course will begin with introducing students to different paradigms of inquiry and research with implications for methodology. It will then provide an overview of how to formulate research questions and hypotheses, identify unit of analysis, conceptualize and operationalize variables of interest. The students will be familiarized with random and non-random methods of sampling. The discourse on research ethics will be an integral part of most discussions in this course.
