Introduction and classification of phase transformation. Diffusion in Solid: Fick’s 1st and 2nd laws, The Kirkendall Effect, Darken’s analysis, various diffusion mechanisms. Thermodynamics of Transformation: Free energy of solid solutions, order of transformation, driving force for first order transformation with and without composition change, Second Order transformation, Spinodal decomposition. Nucleation kinetics: Homogeneous and heterogeneous nucleation, homogeneous nucleation with composition change, Heterogeneous nucleation, Strain energy effects. Growth Kinetics: Diffusion- controlled and Interface-controlled growth. Overall transformation kinetics, Johnson-Mehl-Avarami model. Particle coarsening. Recovery, Recrystallization and Grain Growth. Diffusionless transformation: Martensitic transformation. Solidification.
