Introduction, constitutive modeling of elastic orthotropic, elasto- plastic isotropic, and viscoelastic isotropic solids. Plane stress problems in polar coordinate system, bending of rectangular plates- Navier and Levyâ€™s solution, bending of circular plates, membrane theory of shells, bending of cylindrical shells, vibration and buckling of rectangular plates. Flow measurement, velocity measurement, multi-hole probes and optical measurements. External flows, boundary layers (laminar and turbulent); estimation of lift and drag, internal flows, application to pipe lines.
