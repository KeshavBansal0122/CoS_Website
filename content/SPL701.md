The course will begin with a brief theoretical understanding of policy making processes and touch upon the specifics of science and technology policy systems in India. It will specifically examine the role of stakeholders in the process such as grassroots voices and civil society organisations, industry, academia, international actors, and policy makers. It will then examine the role of science and technology in policies in selected current and emerging key sectors, e.g. transport, agriculture, health, energy, environment, or information and communication technologies. The course will also explore the inherently political and contested nature of decision making in the policy arena.
