This module introduces students to the theory and practice of ethnography. Issue of representation, objectivity and experience render challenges to the presumed ‘objectivity’ of social science research. The module engages with debates on ethnographic representation from the early development of anthropology through to feminist, postcolonial and postmodern critiques. It addresses questions of ethics and subjectivity in the conduct of ethnographic fieldwork especially in troubled times of violence or conflict. The module addresses conceptual issues of how to locate the ‘field’ as well as the practice of conducting ethnographic research through tools such as participant observation and life histories.
