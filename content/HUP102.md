This course will expose students to various experimental methodologies in sub-fields of Psychology and Psycho/Cognitive-linguistics. These will be behavioral experiments that will investigate theoretical questions (e.g., psychological questions related to perception, attention, emotion, choice behavior; psycho-linguistic questions related to sentence comprehension, sentence production, memory, attention, language-perception interaction). The course will illustrate ways in which theoretical/practical research query pertaining to human cognition is translated into a testable problem with the help of widely used behavioral methods.
