This laboratory course is designed to make the students familiar with fundamental experiments related with materials synthesis and their primary characterization. Experiments are based on materials synthesis by solid-state reaction route, Spray-pyrolysis, spin and dip coating, thermal evaporation and sputtering, Dry and Wet Oxidation of Silicon, Understanding of binary eutectic phase diagrams, phase transitions, etc. and study of the optical, electrical, semiconducting and dielectric properties of the synthesized materials. Simulation experiments to understand the properties of solid state materials (e.g. ion-matter interaction, properties of low dimensional materials and band structure estimation) are also included.
