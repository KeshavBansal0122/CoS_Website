Department: Department of Applied Mechanics

Experimental Analysis: Types of measurements and errors, Relative frequency distribution, Histogram, True value, Precision of measurement, Method of least squares, the curve fitting, General linear regression,Theory of errors, Binomial and Gaussian distribution, Chi-square test.

Experimental Methods: Principles of Measurement, Basic Elements of a Measuring Device.

Displacement measurement,Force and Torque Measurement, Temperature Measurement, Pressure Measurement, Fluid Velocity Measurement, Miscellaneous measurements.

Dynamics of Measurements: Dynamic Response of a Measuring Instrument, Response to Transient and Periodic Signals, First and Second order systems as well as their Dynamic Response Characteristics. Laboratory: The experiments have been designed to understand experimental Analysis physically. Laboratory will enable the students to apply various statistical methodologies (viz. Mean, Median, Mode, Std Dev. etc) to get the optimum output from the day to day Engineering life experiment.
