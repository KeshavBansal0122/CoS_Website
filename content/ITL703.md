Department: Centre for Automotive Research and Tribology

Introduction to tribology and its historical background. Factors influencing Tribological phenomena. Engineering surfaces â€“ Surface characterization, Computation of surface parameters. Surface measurement techniques. Apparent and real area of contact.

Contact of engineering surfaces- Hertzian and non-hertzian contact. Contact pressure and deformation in non-conformal contacts. Genesis of friction, friction in contacting rough surfaces, sliding and rolling friction, Various laws and theory of friction. Stick-slip friction behaviour, frictional heating and temperature rise. Friction measurement techniques. Wear and wear types. Mechanisms of wear - Adhesive, abrasive, corrosive, erosion, fatigue, fretting, etc., Wear of metals and non-metals. Wear models - asperity contact, constant and variable wear rate, geometrical influence in wear models, wear damage. Wear in various mechanical components, wear controlling techniques. Introduction to lubrication. Lubrication regimes. Introduction to micro and nano-tribology.
