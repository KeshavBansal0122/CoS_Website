Credits: 3 (3-0-0)

Department: Department of Humanities and Social Sciences

Prerequisites: Any Two courses from HUL2XX category 

Allocation Preference: HUL251, HUL258, HUL253, HUL256 The course is a critical study of the problem of the self taken to be a substance by some and denied to have any substantial reality by others. Focus will be given on examining the worldview from which stems the idea of a continuing self, as a subject of consciousness and agent of action. Questions about whether it is material or immaterial, real or nominal object will centre the ontological investigation into

the nature of the self. Special consideration will be given to the issue of self-awareness and self-reference, and its relation to the linguistic phenomenon of the first-person pronoun ‘I’.
