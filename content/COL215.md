Credits: 5 (3-0-4)

Department: Department of Computer Science and Engineering

Prerequisites: [[COL100]], [[ELL101]]

Overlaps with: ELL201

The course contents can be broadly divided into two parts. First part deals with the basics of circuit design and includes topics like circuit minimization, sequential circuit design and design of and using RTL building blocks. The second part is focused on ASIC style system design and introduces VHDL, FPGA as implementation technology, synthesis steps as well as testing techniques. Course ends with introducing the challenges of embedded design where software is becoming integral to all devices. The laboratory assignments are a key component of this course and requires students to design and implement circuits and sub-systems on FPGA kits covering almost all the topics covered in the lectures.
