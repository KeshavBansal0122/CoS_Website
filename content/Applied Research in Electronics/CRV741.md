title: "CRV741 Acoustic Classification using Passive Sonar"
---
**Credits:** 1 (1-0-0)

#### Description
The challenges faced by a sonar designer, involved in developing underwater classification systems will be introduced and possible solutions will be discussed. The radiated noise characteristics from marine vessels and the unique characteristics of the acoustic signature with respect to the class of the marine platform will be presented. Recent research work has shown that classical homomorphic signal processing techniques and other channel inversion techniques can be used to significantly reduce the unwanted underwater channel distortions that otherwise affect the classifier performance drastically. The course shall provide insight into some of the methods that can improve sonar classification performance.
