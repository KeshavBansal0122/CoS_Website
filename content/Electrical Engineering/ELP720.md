**Credits:** 3 (0-1-4)



#### Description 
Contents: Development of network elements such as routers, SNMP nodes. Use of laboratory and telecom field test instruments such as: oscilloscopes, oscillators, RMS meters, transmission impairment measuring systems, return loss meters, etc. Enables students to study voice and data switching functions and to measure transmission and traffic characteristics on models of the major business communication systems and carrier transmission facilities (controlled LAN environments, Ethernet, E1, T1 / T3lines). Experimental procedures include the use of frequency and time division multiplex systems and the modulation techniques employed by in such systems and the observation of noise and distortion effects.
