**Credits:** 3 (3-0-0)



**Prerequisites:** [[/Electrical Engineering/ELL205 | ELL205]], [[/Electrical Engineering/ELL311 | ELL311]]

#### Description 
Discrete random variables (Bernoulli, binomial, Poisson, geometric, negative binomial, etc.) and their properties like PDF, CDF, MGF. Continuous random variables: Gaussian, multivariate Gaussian; whitening of the Gaussian random vector; complex Gaussian random vector, circularity; Rayleigh and Rician; exponential; chi- squared; gamma.

Signal spaces: convergence and continuity; linear spaces, inner product spaces; basis, Gram-Scmidt orthogonalization.

Stochastic convergence, law of large numbers, central limit theorem. Random processes: stationarity; mean, correlation, and covariance functions, WSS random process; autocorrelation and cross-correlation functions; transmission of a random process through a linear filter;

power spectral density; white random process; Gaussian process; Poisson process.
