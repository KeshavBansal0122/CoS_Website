System Modeling – model structures (Process model, ARX model), Review of concepts of stability, feedback and feedforward control.

Classical control – First-Order Plus Dead-Time model (FOPDT), process reaction curves, Second-Order Plus Dead-Time model (SOPDT), relay feedback process identification; Smith Predictor and its variations, PID controllers and their tuning, Ziegler-Nichols and Cohen-Coon techniques.

Reliable State Feedback design – pole placement, eigenstructure assignment, region based eigenvalue assignment, eigenstructure-time response relationships. Controller gain selection – noise sensitivity. Controller robustness. Disturbance rejection. Frequency Domain Loop Shaping. Output feedback control – compensator design, review of Lead, Lag and Lag-Lead compensators, Zero dynamics – significance in servo control design, design for unstable zero dynamics. Observers – concept and design philosophy. Applications in practical controller design scenarios.
