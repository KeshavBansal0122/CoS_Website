#### Description
Capacity of single-user Gaussian multi-antenna deterministic channels and optimal strategies. Reliable transmission in single user state dependent channels. Capacity of Gaussian single-antenna fading channels with state (RX CSI, Full CSI). Capacity of single-antenna frequency-selective fading channels (OFDM modulation, waterfilling across frequency). Capacity of Gaussian multi-antenna single user fading channels (RX CSI only, Full CSI). Spatial multiplexing gain, array gain. Transmitter and receiver architectures, V-BLAST transmission, Zero-Forcing receiver, MMSE receiver, MMSESIC receiver. Optimality of MMSE-SIC. Capacity region of the multi-user Gaussian MAC channel. Capacity region of the multiuser Gaussian Broadcast channel (BC) with single-antenna terminals. Capacity of state dependent channels with non-causal side information (Gelfand-Pinsker coding). Dirty paper coding to pre-cancel known interference. MAC-BC duality. Capacity region of the multi-user Gaussian Broadcast channel with multi-antenna terminals (Dirty paper coding achieves the capacity region). Capacity region of the Interference channel. There are no laboratory or design activities involved in this course.
