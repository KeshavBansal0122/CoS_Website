**Prerequisites:** [[/Physics/PYL101 | PYL101]]

#### Description 
Review of Maxwellâ€™s equations, wave propagations in unbounded medium. Boundary conditions, reflection and refraction of plane waves. Evanescent waves and surface plasmons. Waveguides: parallel-plane guide, TE, TM and TEM waves, rectangular and cylindrical waveguides, resonators. Dielectric guides and optical fibres. Transmission Lines: distributed parameter circuits, traveling and standing waves, impedance matching, Smith chart, analogy with plane waves. Planar transmission lines: stripline, micro stripline. Radiation: retarded potentials, Hertzian dipole, short loop, antenna parameters. Numerical techniques in electromagnetics.
