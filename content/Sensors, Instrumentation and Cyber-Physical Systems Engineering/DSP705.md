**Credits:** 3 (0-0-6)

#### Description
Experiments on design, simulation and verification of instrumentation sub-systems addressing the following objectives:

the performance of practical transducer systems and their processing circuits dealing with other devices and circuital noise validation of algorithms for information extraction from sensor signatures dynamic range, threshold and sensitivity characterization and response time evaluation in practical environments.

Experiments based on Digital Signal Processing hardware and software to: Study of DSP architecture; Interfacing with peripheral components; Implementation of DSP algorithm; Experiments based on Talbot effect, Digital Speckle Pattern Interferometry and Shack Hartmann Sensor.
