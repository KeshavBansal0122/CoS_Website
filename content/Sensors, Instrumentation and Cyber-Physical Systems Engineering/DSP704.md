    title: DSP704 Instrument Technology Laboratory 2
---
**Credits:** 3 (0-0-6)



#### Description 
The laboratory supports the subjects taught in the second semester courses. The laboratory consists experiments on:

Study of various techniques used for analog and digital conditioning of signals from various transducers/ detectors; Study on modulation/ demodulation techniques, noise generation and measurement, Study of testing and calibration methods of instruments. The structure of experiments has been designed to impart design level familiarity with various subsystems of instrumentation set up. The subsystems may consist of a detector-transducer, signal conditioner, a level power amplifier, display, actuator/final control element. The study will generally focus attention on one of the subsystems. In electronics conditioning. Specific Case Study Experiments as below:
- Experiments in Control involving speed, position, temperature controls using MATLAB
- Experiments in Heat Conduction/ Convection. And Heat Sink Characterisation
- Data conversion, ADC & DAC, synchronous detectors, multipliers, dividers, instrumentation amplifiers
- Microprocessor/Microcontroller based system design with emphasis on real world interfacing
- Experiments on precision measurement methods and metrology.
