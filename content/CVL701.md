Site Investigation: Geophysical methods-Seismic, electrical; Drilling methods; Boring in soils and rocks. Field tests: In-situ tests, SPT, DCPT, SCPT, in-situ vane shear test, pressure meter test, plate load test. Sampling techniques and disturbances. Shallow Foundations: Design considerations, codal provisions. Bearing capacity theories, Layered soils, Choice of shear strength parameters. Bearing capacity from field tests. Total and differential settlements. Deep foundations: Types of piles. Construction methods. Axial capacity of single piles. Axial capacity of groups. Settlement of single piles and groups. Uplift capacity (including under-reamed piles) . Negative skin friction. Pile load tests. Pile integrity tests. Codal provisions. Caissons.

Laterally Loaded Piles: Analysis and Design; Foundations in Difficult soil conditions.
