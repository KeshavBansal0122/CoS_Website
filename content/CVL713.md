Credits: 3 (3-0-0)

Department: Department of Civil Engineering

Introduction. Types and classification of underground openings.

Factors affecting design. Design methodology. Functional aspects. Size and shapes. Support systems. Codal provisions. Analysis: Stresses and deformations around openings, Stresses and deformations around tunnels and galleries with composite lining due to internal pressure, Closed form solutions, BEM, FEM. Design: Design based on analytical methods; Empirical methods based on RSR, RMR, Q systems; Design based on Rock support interaction analysis; Observational method- NATM, Convergence-confinement method. Design based on Wedge failure and key block analysis. Design of Shafts and hydraulic tunnels. Stability of excavation face and Tunnel portals. Use of appropriate software packages.
