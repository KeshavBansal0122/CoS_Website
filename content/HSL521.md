The course touches on some primary theoretical questions that led to the rise of a cognitive science movement in the mid-20th century. Starting off with a critique of behaviorism, the course will introduce students to the works of the early cognitive scientists working in different disciplines (psychology, linguistics, computer science, neuroscience, economics) that shaped this interdisciplinary enterprise of the mind. Other topics that will be covered include representation and computation; information processing (symbolic and sub-symbolic systems); organization of the mind and modularity.
