Prerequisites: Any Two courses from HUL2XX category

Though empirical questions are central in motivating the issues on distribution, this course will mostly draw from theory. Papers published in established journals will cover the major references for this course. It will start from some empirical pattern of development (Kuznetâ€™s hypothesis), country experiences, etc. to motivate the subject. Then it will try to understand the process of distribution, growth and structural change using standard macroeconomic models. This course will be heavily dependent on Mathematics - mainly calculus.
