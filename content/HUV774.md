Department: Department of Humanities and Social Sciences

As sociologists increasingly turn to the past for an understanding of the present, the discipline has incorporated methods from historical research. These include debates on what constitutes an archive, the production of the past as an exercise of power, and how to read historical sources in an ethnographic vein. The significance of the ‘fragment’ or documentary evidence for ethnographic research will be considered. This module will introduce students to some of these larger methodological and theoretical debates from history and sociology.
