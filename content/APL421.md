Review of basics of the Finite Volume Method (FVM): discretization schemes, time stepping, stability, types of grid, iterative solution methods. Structured and unstructured grid generation. Projects on simulations of steady laminar flow (lid driven cavity and boundary layer flow), unsteady laminar flow (flow past a cylinder), turbulent flows (using Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations, channel flow and pipe flow), large eddy simulation, direct numerical simulations and extraction of various statistics from raw CFD data.
