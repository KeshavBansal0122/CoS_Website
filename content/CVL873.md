- Fire engineering: fundamentals of fire science, fire dynamics, hazard mitigation, and safety; codes, standards, rules and fire safety regulations; thermodynamics, thermofluids, heat and mass transfer; human behavior in fire and urban planning; fire testing methods for materials; large-scale fire testing. “Fire protection” - current methods in fire safety engineering; mechanics of repair; mitigation of fire damage by due design, and construction; industrial fire safety. Passive fire protection: analyzing the thermal effects of fires on buildings and designing structural members. Introduction to active fire protection.
- Structural fire engineering: fire behavior and scenarios, heat transfer to the structure, structural response and stability under thermo-mechanical loads; fire safety design; mechanical properties of structural materials at elevated temperatures; fire response of steel, concrete, fiber reinforced polymers, high-performance materials etc.; computational procedures to predict structural behavior under fire conditions; structural fire resistance based on theoretical/ empirical relationships; performance-based fire engineering; strengthening/ repair of structures.
