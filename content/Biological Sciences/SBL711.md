#### Description 
Signaling as a basis of cellular communications, conversion of information into cellular response, first messenger, intracellular and extracellular receptors, second messenger, signaling proteins, signal amplification, cascade formation, adaptors, domains, scaffold, recruitment of signaling proteins, pseudosubstrates, convergence, divergence, cross talk, molecular switches, critical nodes, multisite protein phosphorylation, G-protein coupled signal transduction, nuclear receptors, growth factors and tyrosine kinases, mitogen activated protein kinases, insulin signal transduction, phosphatases, emerging technologies like antisense, omics, RNAi, high content screening, target hopping, combination of mutations, systems approach to understand signaling complexity.
