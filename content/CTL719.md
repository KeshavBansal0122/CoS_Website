Introduction to the automobile, different subsystems and assemblies in an automobile, modeling of tires, chassis, suspension, steering, transmission and brakes. Understanding subsystems responsible for ensuring satisfactory longitudinal, lateral and vertical dynamics performance of vehicles. Suspension kinematics and compliance, brake design and force portioning; anti-lock braking; vehicle stability and tire friction ellipse; traction control; different types of vehicle transmission systems, steering and handling; ride quality and suspension control; introduction to hybrid and electric vehicles. Vehicle control: longitudinal acceleration control; yaw rate control; lateral positioning; path planning/tracking; adaptive cruise control; automatic vehicle following and convoys. Testing of vehicle performance and handling; lab based and field-testing approaches; Different sophistications of lab based vehicle testing: MIL, SIL and HIL.
