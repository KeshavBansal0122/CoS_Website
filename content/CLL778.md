Structure of biomacromolecules. Attributes of biomacromolecules: size, charge, hydrophobicity. Characteristics of surface and interfaces: roughness, charge, hydrophobicity. Interactions between biomacromolecules and interfaces: adsorption, specific binding. Aggregation of proteins, modeling of the underlying phenomena. Elasticity of adsorbed macro-molecules at interfaces. Equilibrium and transient description of transport of biomolecules through intra- and extracellular space. Governing equations applied to biological systems: conservation laws, flux equations, Fickian and non-Fickian diffusion, diffusion with reaction/ binding, electrochemical transport. Constitutive laws and solution methods applied to biological systems. Adsorption isotherms and transport across membrane.
