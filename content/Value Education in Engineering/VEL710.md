The values inherent in The Traditional Knowledge Systems (TKS) viz., respect for all life and non-life, respect for diversity; awareness of social and ecological impact of activities; self-sufficiency; sustainability, socially appropriate, use of local natural and knowledge resources viz., decentralized, aesthetically pleasing, wealth distributive etc. It would be emphasized that these values are inherently present in the framework of traditional knowledge systems and are not add-ons. Traditional Technologies which are developed as part of the TKS framework are invented and tested in the field, where all environmental and social interaction, in particular its effect on other life-forms known and unknown are allowed to play their part. This non-fragmented approach makes such knowledge holistic and avoids the errors and pitfalls when technologies are applied on the basis of incomplete or inadequate theories.
