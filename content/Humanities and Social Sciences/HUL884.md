**Credits:** 3 (3-0-0)

**Prerequisites:** [[/Humanities and Social Sciences/HUL275|HUL275]]

#### Description
The course introduces different understandings about categories of ‘environment’ and ‘environmentalism’ that have emerged in contemporary thought, and its implications to its study in within an ethics framework. It seeks to explore three tropes. First, is a foray into the nature-culture debate, a debate central to environmental ethics. It seeks to lay the basis for the field by tracing key texts in the debate, viz., how the category of ‘nature’ is understood to be something which is external to humans. Second, we seek to understand the ways in which the ‘crisis’ in environment is constructed, a crisis which then would require certain ethical approaches to amelioration of our relationship with our surroundings. Third, is an exploration of specific themes in the field of contemporary environmental ethics - critical environmental aesthetics, applied ethics in agriculture, and explore ethical frameworks from non Western realms like in the Indic context, and Buddhist environmental ethics. This course looks at the imperatives and politics that shaped the literatures and discourses that shaped environmental ethics as a distinct discipline.
