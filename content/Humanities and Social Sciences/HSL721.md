**Credits:** 3 (1-0-4)



#### Description 
In the module for qualitative methods, we will start by discussing the qualitative research paradigm, noting the ontological and epistemological assumptions and values of reflexivity and subjectivity. We then learn about planning and designing qualitative research and consider the sampling requirements and ethical concerns.

In the module for experimental methods, we will first introduce the assumptions behind experimentation and the defining its nature and scope. We will then introduce topics such as control, randomization, design, factors, etc. that will equip the students to understand and test a scientific prediction using experimentation. The module will be a mix of lectures and practical sessions. Practical sessions will complement core concepts taught in the lectures by allowing the students to design their own experiment, collect data and do some preliminary analysis.

Finally, in the module for computational methods, we will introduce the students to some examples of data analytics and basic machine learning models.
