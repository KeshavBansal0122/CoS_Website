This course explores the connection between sounds and words. While the correlation between the meaning and sounds of a word are arbitrary, the string of sounds or phonological shape of words and other morphological units follow certain universal well-formedness principles. While many of these principles derive from the manner in which individual languages form rhythmic/ prosodic domains in speech, some make crucial reference to morphological notions such as homonymy and synonymy. The aim of the course is to impart certain theoretical tools to analyze words from any natural language data. Since the objective of the course is to learn to analyze natural language data, it involves a substantial practical component.
