#### Description 
Political sociology is an important and integral component of sociology. It deals with state-society relationship, the structures of power and authority, and the dynamics of social and political change in society. It goes beyond the analysis of mere political institutions such as the state, political parties and electoral politics and tries to look at political change through the dynamic and contingent relationship of the political with that of the other institutions such as the social and economic. Political sociology also examines and explains the way in which traditional systems of caste, ethnicity, religion and tribe interact with modern institutions like state, democracy, secularism, citizenship, and governance in the Indian context.
