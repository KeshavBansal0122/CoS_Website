#### Description
This course will study the various aspects of Indian theatre. The linkages between ancient theatre forms and existing forms of indigenous performance in various parts of India – such as the nautanki, the tamasha and the jatra. The energies which were generated in the urban centres through the encounter with European drama – the Parsi theatre, the nascent Marathi stage, the Hindi theatre of Bhartendu Harishchandra and the nationalist theatre of Calcutta – will be explored. Special attention would be paid to the transformation of theatre values with the intervention of the Indian People’s Theatre Association (IPTA). The focus for the post-Independence period would be on the diverse energies of urban theatre, group theatre and the ‘back to the roots’ movement. The course would require students to study play-scripts as well as look at accompanying literature to form a concrete idea of the philosophy behind Indian theatrical practice.
