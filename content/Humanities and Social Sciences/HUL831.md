#### Description 
The course would study the history of the print while keeping in perspective the changes in transmission of knowledge brought about by changes in technologies of representation â€“ oral, manuscript, print. The coming of print is accompanied by the regulation of knowledge circulation by systems of profit. This amalgamation leads to the emergence of the idea of copyright which is further strengthened by the conceptualisation of the author as a genius. The course will study the prospects of the concepts of the author and copyright in the digital age.
