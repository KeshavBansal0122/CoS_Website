**Credits:** 3 (2-1-0)

#### Description
Recent developments in linguistics, philosophy and the social sciences; interdisciplinary cross-talk in these areas, concerning the status of canonical literary as well as marginal texts; feminist, post-modernist, post-colonial, subaltern, orientalist, new historicist, liberal Marxist and critical practice. The aim of the course is to familiarise students with some of the vocabulary of theoretical inquiry today, so that they are enabled in their own research to question the verities which their disciplines seem to offer.
