**Credits:** 3 (3-0-0)



**Prerequisites:** [[/Humanities and Social Sciences/HUL742 | HUL742]]: Transformational Theories of Language Or prior permission of the course co-ordinator

#### Description 
his is an advanced course in theoretical syntax and will benefit students interested in learning more about recent generative syntactic theories. There are two main objectives of the course: a) to provide the rationale for the ‘Strong Minimalist Thesis: language as an optimal system’; and, b) to learn to generate syntactic structures using fewer transformations/operations and features and, with stronger economy considerations. On finishing the course, students will be familiar with both theoretical (substantive) aspects of the minimalist architecture of grammar, as well the technical (methodological) know-how of the system.
