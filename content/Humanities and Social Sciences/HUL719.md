#### Description
1. Review of Classical Linear Regression Model: Gauss-Markov assumptions, finite sample properties, large sample properties.
2. Instrumental Variable Estimation: Motivation for instrumentation, Simultaneity Bias, Endogeneity and Measurement Error; IV Estimation; 2SLS Estimation.
3. Generalized Method of Moments: Single equation linear GMM.
4. Systems of Equations: Seemingly unrelated Regressions (SUR) model; Simultaneous Equations Models: Identification.
5. Panel Data models: Pooled Estimation; unobserved Heterogeneity: Fixed vs. Random Effects; ML vs. GMM estimation.
6. Discrete Choice Models: Binary response models, Multinomial Response Models, ordered Response Models.
7. Censored Regression Models: Estimation and Inference with Censored Tobit.
8. Estimating Average Treatment Effects: Regression Methods, Methods Based on the Propensity Score, Estimating the ATE using IV.
