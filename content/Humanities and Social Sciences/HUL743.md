#### Description
This is a literature review course that will explore the existing literature in the domains of Language Acquisition (both first and second), Language teaching (approaches and methods), as well as language assessment. In doing so, the course will include aspects of the philosophy of language, and the resultant application of these philosophical approaches in the form of classroom pedagogy. The course will also include substantial literature on "action research" where language teachers have written about the results of implementing various cognitive tasks in their classroom.
