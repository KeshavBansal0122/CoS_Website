What is religion? What role does it play in modern democratic societies? How does it influence the everyday life-world, belief system, and identity of an individual or a community? And, what are the relationships between the sacred and secular or religion and modernity? Addressing these questions, this course examines the various concepts, theories and debates in the sociology/anthropology of religion. Contrary to the predictions of the secularisation hypothesis, which envisaged the decline or privatisation of religion with the spread of modernity and techno-scientific rationality, it is observed that there is a religious resurgence or de-secularisation of the world. Religion has assumed a more public role. Given this, the course will examine the implications of religionâ€™s resurgence and active public role for modern democratic societies as well as the broader process of social order and social change.
