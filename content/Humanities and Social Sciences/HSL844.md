Department: Department of Humanities and Social Sciences

Prerequisites: [[/Humanities and Social Sciences/HSL522 | HSL522]], or a similar programming course, [[/Humanities and Social Sciences/HUL242 | HUL242]] or [[/Humanities and Social Sciences/HSL541 | HSL541]], [[/Humanities and Social Sciences/HSL748 | HSL748]]

Models of word and sentence meaning are some of the most crucial elements for building intelligent systems for language understanding. This course will cover the cognitive underpinnings of computational models of word similarity, ontologies such as WordNet and frameworks such as Abstract meaning Representation (for sentence meaning). The course will also examine applications of such models for carrying out natural language processing tasks like inference and entailment.
