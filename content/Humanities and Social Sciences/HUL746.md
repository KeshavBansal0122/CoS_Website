#### Description
This course explores the connection between a unit of acoustic speech signal and its environment (sounds preceding or following it). Phonological theory is thus composed on context-free and context-sensitive notions of markedness. While these are supposed to be universal, individual languages might vary significantly in prioritizing between these. The course therefore involves a major practical component where the speech units of individual languages (vowels, consonants and tones) are studied with respect to their phonological contexts.
