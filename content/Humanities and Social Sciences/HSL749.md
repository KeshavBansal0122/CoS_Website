**Prerequisites:** For UGs: [[/Humanities and Social Sciences/HUL242 | HUL242]], [[/Humanities and Social Sciences/HUL350 | HUL350]], [[/Humanities and Social Sciences/HUL381 | HUL381]] and [[/HUL234 | HUL234]]

#### Description 
The objective of this course is to study two models of constraint based grammars: namely Optimality Theory and Harmonic Grammar. While OT ranks constraints with respect to each other leading to a direct conflict between competing constraints, Harmonic Grammar positions these on a linear scale according to their weights.
