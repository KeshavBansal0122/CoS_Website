**Credits:** 1.5 (0.5-0-2)

**Prerequisites:** [[/Humanities and Social Sciences/HSL721|HSL721]]

#### Description
We will first introduce the students to the basics of computational modeling. We will discuss examples of computational models and the question of what can be learnt. Students will be introduced to two learning algorithms: decision trees and logistic regression. They will learn about validation of their models, both internally and externally. During the course practical, they will get the opportunity to train their own computational models to solve a simple problem.
