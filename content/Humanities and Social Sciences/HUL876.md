#### Description
This course seeks to build awareness of what is ethnography â€“ both as a research method and as a way of seeing/being/acting. It seeks to understand and theorize the nature of the relationship forged between the researcher and the field. The course will involve a close reading of ethnographic texts that deploy a range of techniques that involves both classic as well as inter-disciplinary styles of ethnography such as sensory and auto-ethnography.
