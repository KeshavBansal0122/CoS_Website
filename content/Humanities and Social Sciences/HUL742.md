#### Description
This course will cover the fundamental concepts that have defined generative/transformational grammars since their inception in the 1950s. It will introduce students to the main motivations for such grammars for natural language, as stated in Chomsky (1957). A substantial part of the course will therefore be devoted to understanding the inadequacies of immediate constituent analysis and the need to include optional and obligatory transformational rules in the grammar. This will be followed by a detailed study of later theoretical developments, including those found in Standard Theory, Extended Standard Theory, Revised Extended Standard Theory and Government and Binding Theory.
