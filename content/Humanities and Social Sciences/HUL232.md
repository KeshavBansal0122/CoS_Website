---
**Credits:** 4 (3-1-0)



**Prerequisites:** [[/NLN101 | NLN101]]

#### Description 
Students would be introduced to the conditions, beginning in 19th century colonial rule in India, which led to the emergent Indian middle-class intelligentsia to experiment with European forms of literature but striving for an alternative expression. Indian languages became the medium through which writers sought to address issues of identity, tradition, modernity, gender, the rural and the urban, the private and the public. The course will study the various experiments in narration, language, characterization and style undertaken by authors to shape these themes.
