#### Description
This course examines different aspects of meaning/semantics in language. Some specific questions addressed here are: a) what is meaning?, b) how do we use words to convey meanings?, and c) how does our grammatical knowledge interact with the interpretive system? We try to answer these and other questions while introducing students to the formal techniques used in research on the semantics of natural language.
