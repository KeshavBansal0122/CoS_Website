The course will undertake a detailed study of some of the most iconic Modernist novels by writers such as Virginia Woolf, James Joyce, Franz Kafka and Samuel Beckett. It will examine the radical new ways in which they grappled with language, turned towards interiority, and pushed, in the process, narrative art to its very limits. The discussion will highlight the experimental quality of Modernist literature, as well as situate it within the context of its emergence - the two world wars, the development of psychoanalysis, the growth of metropolitan cities, and scientific and technological advancements.
