**Credits:** 1.5 (1.5-0-0)



#### Description 
In this course, the students will be introduced to mixed methods research (quantitative and qualitative). They will be familiarized with specific modes of observation such as surveys, focus group discussions, interviews, and participatory rural appraisal, followed by designing specific tools of data collection such as questionnaires and interview protocols for different modes of observation. Special emphasis will be given to household surveys and data from large surveys such as census, NFHS, NSS, migration and urban surveys. This will be followed by elementary data analysis techniques and inferential statistics, converting qualitative data into quantitative data and the use of qualitative data analysis software.
