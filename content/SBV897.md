Blood vessel components – endothelial cells, pericytes, and vascular smooth muscle cells; vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) biology – its role in angiogenesis and vascular permeability; basic fibroblast growth factor biology; VEGF and FGF receptors, tyrosine kinase signaling and activation; angiogenesis and immune system; tumor angiogenesis - Judah Folkman hypothesis, discovery and how the field of vascular biology in cancer has evolved over the years; tumor vasculature and perfusion; antiangiogenesis as a current therapeutic strategy – where we stand?; blood vessel inhibition vs normalization; vessel co-option and vascular mimicry; atherogenesis; anti-angiogenic therapy in age- related macular degeneration; Vascular aging; different in vitro, in vivo, and ex vivo models to study vascular biology.
