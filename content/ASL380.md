Basics of the climate system and introduction to climate modeling. Conservation of mass, momentum, and energy; horizontal and vertical energy transfer, moist processes, and wave processes.

Numerical Modeling (Model overview, initial and boundary conditions, numerical techniques, parameterization of sub-grid scale processes, hierarchy of models, simulation, tuning, validation, and verification) Case studies (Phenomenological and process studies, viz. influence of mountains and surface temperature on atmospheric circulation and precipitation distributions, etc.; modeling of climate change due to doubling of CO2, etc.)
