Introduction to IC Engine Emissions; IC Engine's Regulated emissions (CO, HC, NOx, PM and CO2) and Greenhouse gas emissions (CO2, CH4, and N2O), Transient emissions; Formation mechanism of these emissions (soot morphology, PM's size and count etc.) in IC Engines, Effect of combustion characteristics on emissions of IC engine, Effect of alternative and renewable fuels on emissions of IC engine, Control strategies of emission at source level: Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR), Water injection, Use of gaseous fuels including hydrogen and natural gas, Control strategies for exhaust gas emissions with after-treatment devices: Catalytic control technologies, Oxidation Catalysts, Reduction catalysts, Three way Catalysts (TWC), Nonselective catalytic reduction (NSCR), Selective catalytic reduction (SCR), Diesel oxidation catalysts (DOC), Particulate emission control, Diesel particulate filter (DPF), Emission reduction of IC engine with renewable energy system under hybrid mode, National (Bharat Stage, CPCB etc.) and International (EPA, EURO etc.) Current and future national and international emission regulations of IC engines / vehicles and emission testing procedures (ESC, ETC, 5-mode, 8-mode and 13 mode tests).
