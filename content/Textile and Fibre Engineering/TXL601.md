#### Description 
This is an audit bridge course designed for M.Tech and Ph.D students with non-Textile background. The program is not available for B.Tech students. The course is divided into four modules giving an overview on a) Fibre Science: Polymers, Textile Fibres and their classification, Homopolymer, copolymers and graft polymers; their molecular weight, distribution, architecture, configuration and confirmations, amorphous and crystalline phases, glass transition, crystallization and melting, Step growth and chain polymerization; Basic Introduction to Fibre structure, general properties such as moisture absorption, tenacity, elongation, initial modulus, yield point, toughness and elastic properties, Spinning, Melt spinning, Solution Spinning and Electrospinning; Introduction to manmade and synthetic fibres: viscose, acetate, acrylic, nylon, polyester, introduction to high performance fibers and their applications.
- Yarn: Classification of yarn, filament and staple, yarn specifications, yarn counting system, yarn diameter, twist and yarn physical and mechanical characteristics; Flow chart of cotton spinning process, Importance of fibre characteristics, Impurities in natural fibres, Cleaning principles, Mixing and blending of fibres; sliver formation by card; Cardic mechanic configuration; Fibre configuration in card sliver, Drafting process, roller and apron drafting; Objectives of combing, Principle of fibre fractionation; Principle of roving preparation and yarn formation, Drafting and different methods of twisting.
- Fabric: Yarn to fabric conversion, Basic principles, Introduction to various fabric formation principles, weaving, knitting, nonwoven and braiding; Weaving principles-stages of woven fabric manufacturing winding, warping, sizing, Drawing in primary and secondary motions, Shuttle and shuttle less looms, Basic fabric design as plain, matt, rib, twill and satin; Knitting: basics warp and weft constructions, different knitting structures and their properties, weft and warp knitting machines; Nonwovens: definitions, classifications, production technology and applications; Braided structures and their technologies and applications.
