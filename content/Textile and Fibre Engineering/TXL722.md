#### Description
Principles of bale management. Forces acting on fibres during opening and cleaning, analysis of fibre compactness and blending in blowroom. Carding process, cylinder load and transfer efficiency, design of high production card, fibre shedding and card wire geometry, fibre configuration in card and drawn sliver. Fibre movement in drafting field, drafting wave, drafting force, roller slip, roller eccentricity and vibration, autolevelling. Fibre fractionation in comber, combing performance. Analysis of forces on yarn and traveller, spinning tension in ring and rotor spinning, spinning geometry, twist flow in ring and rotor spinning, end breaks. Mechanism of drafting and yarn formation in high speed spinning systems.
