**Credits:** 3 (2-0-2)

#### Description
Classification of fibres. Basic structure of a fibre. General properties of a fibre such as moisture absorption, tenacity, elongation, initial modulus, yield point, toughness, elastic recovery. Relationship between polymer structure and fiber properties. Detailed chemical and physical structure of natural fibres: cotton, wool and silk, their basic properties. Introduction to important bast and leaf fibres. Basic introduction to Fibre spinning. Introduction Manmade and synthetic fibres: Viscose, Acetate, Acrylic, Nylon, polyester. High Performance Fibres.

Laboratory exercises would include experiments on fibre identification through physical appearance, microscopic (optical, SEM), and burning behaviour. Chemical identification through solvent treatment and elemental analysis.
