Credits: 3.0 (3-0-0)

Department: Department of Humanities and Social Sciences

Prerequisites: Any two courses in the HUL2XX or HUL3XX categories

This course trains students to understand the social dynamics of different types of organisations, with a focus on practices of work and the making of workplaces. While familiarising students with the theoretical approaches and concepts necessary to understand the individual as relationship to the organisation, it will enable students to think critically about questions of identity, agency, power and control in organisational spaces. We discuss the interface of culture, ways of thinking, feeling, acting and being in different organisations. This enables a shift from the managerial perspectives and psycho-social views of organisations, and draws out the complex negotiations and tensions endemic to organisational life. The course also draws on literature on different types of organisations such as hospitals, prisons and corporations to elaborate the unique cultural configurations in these spaces and contexts.
