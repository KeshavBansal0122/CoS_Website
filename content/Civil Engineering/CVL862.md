Department: Department of Civil Engineering

Rudiments of offshore engineering; sea spectra; wave theories; wave- structure interaction. Design of offshore platforms: introduction, fixed and floating platforms. Buoyed structures/ articulated towers; tension- leg platform (TLP); Marine risers; compliant and non-compliant structures; offshore pipelines and risers; Steel, concrete, and hybrid platforms. Buoys and mooring system design; Design criteria and code provisions. Environmental loading. Wind, wave and current loads. Loads and stability during handling and towing. Introduction to stochastic dynamics of ocean structures considering different sea spectra. Soil-structure interaction (SSI): beam on Winkler foundation (p-y curve approach). Dynamic analysis of SPAR platforms. Fatigue analysis of fixed and floating offshore structure: stress concentration, S-N curves. Foundations: site investigations, gravity, jacket platforms, hybrid platforms. Piled foundation and behavior under dynamic loading. Static and dynamic analysis of platforms and components. Dynamic analysis using software: response of fixed type offshore structures, articulated towers, single leg and multi-legged towers.
