#### Description
Origin, nature and distribution of soils. Description of individual particle. Clay mineralogy, clay-water-electrolytes. Soil fabric and structure. Effective stress principle. Steady state flow in soils. Effect of flow on effective stress. Determination of coefficient of permeability. Consolidation: one, two, three dimensional and radial consolidation. Various consolidation tests and determination of parameters. Stress-path. Triaxial and direct shear tests. Shear behaviour of soils under static and dynamic loads. Factors affecting shear beahviour.

Determination of parameters. Shear behavior of fine grained soils. Pore-pressure parameters. UU, CU, CD tests. Total and effective stress-strength parameters. Total and effective stress-paths. Water content contours. Factors affecting strength : stress history, rate of testing, structure and temperature. Anisotropy of strength, thixotropy, creep. Determination of in-situ undrained strength. Stress-strain characteristics of soils. Determination of modulus values. Critical state model, Engineering behaviour of soils of India: Black cotton soils, alluvial silts and sands, laterites, collapsible and sensitive soils.
