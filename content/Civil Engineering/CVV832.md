    title: CVV832 Approaches for Contaminated Site Characterization
---
**Credits:** 1 (0.8-0.2-0)



#### Description 
The course will effectively present a sync between the formalization of groundwater contamination problem with the interplay of data requirements, to be obtained from site characterization, and mathematical modelling. For this, in the course modeling approached and geophysical methods from a very bare fundamentals and up to the recent most development will be presented. Subsequently, the usefulness and criticality of quality field-data and modeling methods will be explored with a goal of an efficient contaminated site management. Implementations of field data and numerical methods will be discussed using simple to very complex case-studies.
