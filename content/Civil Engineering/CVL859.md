#### Description
Introduction: Buckling of steel and concrete structures; Conservative and non-conservative loads. Elastic buckling of columns and beam- columns: Static, dynamical and energy-based approaches. Viscoelastic and elastoplastic buckling. Torsional buckling. Flexural-torsional and lateral buckling. Plate and frame buckling. Imperfection sensitivity; Post-buckling theory. Snap-through. Dynamic stability: Divergence, flutter and parametric resonance. Nonlinear dynamical systems theory; Bifurcations. Recent trends.
