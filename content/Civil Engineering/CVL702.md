**Credits:** 3 (3-0-0)

#### Description
Principles of compaction, Engineering behaviour of compacted clays. Shallow stabilization with additives: lime, fly ash and cement. Deep stabilization: stone column, sand drains, prefabricated drains, lime column, soil-lime column, vibro-floatation, dynamic compaction, electro-osmosis. Grouting : permeation, compaction and jet; Dewatering systems. Geosynthetics: types and functions, materials and manufacturing processes, testing and evaluation; Reinforced soil structures: principles of soil reinforcement, application of geotextiles and geogrids in roads, walls, and embankments. Application of geotextiles, geonets and geocomposites as drains and filters. Multiple functions: railways and overlay design. Geosynthetics in environmental control: covers and liners for landfills â€“ material aspects and stability considerations.
