#### Description
Introduction: fundamental relations, models and soil mechanics. Elasticity: Isotropic, anisotropic, soil elasticity. Failure criteria for soils. Plasticity and yielding: yielding of clays, yielding of sands, slip line fields, introduction to upper and lower bounds, selected boundary value problems. Elasto-plastic model for soils: elastic volumetric strains, plastic volumetric strains, plastic hardening, plastic shear strains, plastic potentials, flow rule. Cam clay model: critical state line, shear strength, stress-dilatancy, index properties, prediction of conventional soil tests. Applications.
