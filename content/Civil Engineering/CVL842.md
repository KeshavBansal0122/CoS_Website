Department: Department of Civil Engineering

Prerequisites: M.Tech: [[/Civil Engineering/CVL741 | CVL741]], [[/Civil Engineering/CVL742 | CVL742]]; B.Tech: [[/Civil Engineering/CVL261 | CVL261]] and one TE elective

Introduction to basic road geoemetric design elements and methodology - design philosophy and design techniques; Design controls - human, vehicle and speed related factors. Road vehicle performance - road vehicle dynamics - tractive and resisting forces. Braking forces. Theoretical and practical stopping distances. Elements of geometric design - cross section elements; Horizontal Alignment
- tangents, curves, transitions, superelevation; Vertical Alignment - grades and curves; Coordination of Horizontal and Vertical Alignment. Design of Intersections at-grade- design principles, channelization, roundabouts, Interchanges- types, warrants, lane balancing; Road side safety- hazards and clear zone concept, traffic safety barriers, impact attenuation.
