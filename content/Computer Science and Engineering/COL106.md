#### Description
Introduction to object-oriented programming through stacks queues and linked lists. Dictionaries; skip-lists, hashing, analysis of collision resolution techniques. Trees, traversals, binary search trees, optimal and average BSTs. Balanced BST: AVL Trees, 2-4 trees, red-black trees, B-trees. Tries and suffix trees. Priority queues and binary heaps. Sorting: merge, quick, radix, selection and heap sort, Graphs: Breadth first search and connected components. Depth first search in directed and undirected graphs.

Disjkraâ€™s algorithm, directed acyclic graphs and topological sort. Some geometric data-structures.
