#### Description
Review of the principle of mathematical induction; the principle of structural induction; review of Boolean algebras; Syntax of propositional formulas; Truth and the semantics of propositional logic; Notions of satisfiability, validity, inconsistency; Deduction systems for propositional logic; Completeness of deduction systems; First order logic (FOL); Proof theory for FOL; introduction to model theory; completeness and compactness theorems; First order theories.
