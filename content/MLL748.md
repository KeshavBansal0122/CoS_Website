Prerequisites: Introductory courses on materials, such as [[CLL141]], [[MLL100]]; [[MLL702]], [[CLL732]], [[CLL252]], [[MLL713]], or some

equivalent courses dealing with thermodynamics of solids. Thermodynamic stability diagrams; chemical potential gradient; Gibbs- Duhem equation; steady-state and non-steady states; Fick’s laws of diffusion; Fick’s second law for thin-film and homogenization; random walk model; tracer method; jump frequency and correlation factor; effect of orientation and phase transition on diffusion; point defects in crystalline materials; atomic mechanism of diffusion in stoichiometric and non-stoichiometric oxides, ionic solids and intermetallics; Kirkendall effect; types of diffusion coefficients; vacancy wind effect;

analytical diffusion models; time-dependent growth laws; interface and diffusion-controlled growth; microstructural evolution of the interfacial reaction zones in bulks, thin films and nanomaterials; physicochemical approach; diffusion in multicomponent systems; phase diagram determination by diffusion couple method; short-circuit diffusion; temperature-, purity- and strain-effects on diffusion; Fisher model; kinetic regimes of grain boundary diffusion; grain boundary segregation; capillarity- and stress-driven diffusion; alloying effect on interfacial reactions; thermodynamic-kinetic approach in advanced functional materials.
