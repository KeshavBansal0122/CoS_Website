In the first part of the course, we study neoclassical models of labour market and in the second part we introduce search theoretic models. The modules examine how workers, firms, and the government interact in the labour market. The focus here will be on the theories of wage determination, investment in human capital, labour market discrimination, and job search. The course content is based on recent research articles on these topics
