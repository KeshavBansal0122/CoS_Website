**Credits:** 5 (3-1-2)



**Prerequisites:** [[/Applied Mechanics/APL100 | APL100]]

Overlaps with: APL106, APL105

#### Description 
Introduction to Fluids and the concept of viscosity, Flow visualization, Fluid Statics, Physical laws for a control volume including continuity, momentum and energy equations, Bernoulli equation, Differential equations of fluid motion, Navier Stokes equations, vorticity and potential flows, dimensional analysis and similitude, Boundary layer theory, viscous flow in ducts and applications to turbomachinery. Laboratory experiments will demonstrate the concepts learnt in the theory and appreciation of their limitations.
