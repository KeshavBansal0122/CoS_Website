#### Description 
Basic concepts and definitions, thermodynamic properties of a pure substance. Work and heat – definition and applications. 1st Law – internal energy and enthalpy, applications to non-flow/closed and flow/open systems (SSSF and USUF). 2nd Law – corollaries, Claudius inequality, entropy. Carnot cycle. Basics of gas-vapor mixtures. Vapor power cycles – Rankine cycle and its modifications. Steam generation and its use – power plants, co-generation, combined cycles. Thermodynamic analysis of fluids in standard fixtures and equipment (piping fixtures, power plants, engines, refrigerators). Equilibrium properties of pure materials and mixtures. Understanding the phase behavior and phase transitions of pure fluids.
