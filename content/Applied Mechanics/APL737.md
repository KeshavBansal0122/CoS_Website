#### Description
Overview of static failure theories in terms of failure surface. Fracture Mechanics (stress intensity as a design criterion). Fatigue Failure (emulative damage. Strain-life method). Contact mechanic (rough surface contacts, thermo-elastic contact). Surface Failure (hydrodynamic lubrication. Wear mechanics). Creep (Three / Five- Power Law. Life estimation. Statistical Failure (ANOVA reliability theory).
