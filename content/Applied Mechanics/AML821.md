**Credits:** 3 (3-0-0)

#### Description
General governing equations for solid-fluid interaction problems. Decoupling approximations. Acoustically applied forces. Steady- state scatter, transient scatter and transient shock response. Hydrodynamically applied forces Flow induced noise, dynamic divergence of compliant surfaces, flutter, stability of boundary layer on compliant surfaces, propeller induced forces. Aeroelastic flutter of plates, linear and non-linear response. Flow induced vibrations of pipes and tube arrays etc.
