Introduction to source of CO2 (Greenhouse gas) from thermal energy systems and their Global warming potential (GWP), carbon and CO2 cycle, Scenario of CO2 concentration in atmosphere, Relationship between radiative forcing and greenhouse gas concentration, Estimation of the equilibrium surface temper change, and global warming and climate change. Mechanism of CO2 emission formation during combustion in power plants (steam turbine, gas turbine and internal combustion engines), CO2 emission reduction by use of alternative fuels and energy efficiency improvement in thermal energy system, Measurement and analysis of CO2 emission in heat engines / power plants / thermal energy system. Carbon capture: different methods (physical / chemical / biological) of Carbon capture from power plants, CO2 capture through pre-combustion methods, Oxygen-combustion method, Post-combustion methods (physical solvents/sorbents, membranes, cryogenic fractionation), Chemical-looping combustion and algae species. Carbon storage under empty oil well, Ocean storage, etc. Carbon sequestration: mineral carbonation, Photosynthesis of plants, Fuel production, refrigerant, Dry ice, Fertilizer, Working fluid for power plants, Industrial applications (textile, paint, mining, oil etc.) and Case studies / numerical calculations for energy input requirement for CCS system.
