Department: Department of Materials Science and Engineering

Basic concept of crystallography, crystal structure, stereographic projection, diffraction analysis of crystal structure: X-ray, neutron and electron diffraction, texture analysis, selected area diffraction in electron microscope, micro-analysis in electron microscopy, scanning probe microscopy and related techniques, Chemical characterization will include Rutherford back scattering, Auger, X-ray photoemission, Energy dispersive, Wavelength dispersive, and Raman spectroscopes. Quantitative and tomographic analysis of microstructures (3D diffraction and imaging techniques). Mass spectrometry and NMR spectrometry.
