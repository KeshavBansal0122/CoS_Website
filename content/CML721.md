Selectivity in organic synthesis: chemo-, regio-, stereo- and enantioselectivity. Target-oriented synthesis: Designing organic synthesis, Retrosynthetic analysis, disconnetion approach, linear and convergent synthesis. Diversity-oriented synthesis: concept of forward-synthetic analysis, appendage diversity, skeletal diversity, stereochemical diversity, complexity and diversity. Asymmetric Synthesis: Use of chiral catalysts, organocatalysis, chiron approach and N-heterocyclic carbenes. Principles and use of enzymes in the syntheis of industrially important sugar / fatty acid esters, sugar nucleotide derivatives; enantiomeric pure compounds and biobased platform chemicals.
