#### Description
Introduction to homogeneous catalysis, TON and TOF, Some aspects of commonly used ligands in homogeneous catalysis, such as, CO, amines, phosphines, NHCâ€™s, alkenes, alkynes, carbenes, carbynes, etc., Recent developments in hydrogenation and hydroformylation and their asymmetric variations using OM catalysts, Wacker oxidation, Monsanto and Cativa processes, Olefin and alkyne trimerization and oligomerization, Olefin polymerization using Ziegler-Natta, Titanium group metallocenes, Post metallocene late TM catalysts and FI catalysts, Olefin and alkyne metathesis, Grubbs I, II, and III, Schrock, and Schrock-Hoveyda catalysts, Types of metathesis such as RCM, ROM, ROMP, ADMET, and EM. Applications in industry, Palladium and nickel catalyzed cross coupling reactions such as Suzuki, Heck, Sonogashira, Stille, Negishi, Hiyama, Buchwald- Hartwig, decarboxylative cross coupling, and alpha arylation of carbonyls, Fischer Tropsch Process, C-H activation of alkyls and aryls using transition metal complexes, Organometallic polymers, Bio-organometallic chemistry: Vitamin B-12, Planar chirality of metal sandwich compounds and their applications in industry (e.g. Josiphos catalyst), Ferrocene based drugs, Sustainable catalysis for pharmaceuticals and industry using organometallics.
