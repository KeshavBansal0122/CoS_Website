Department: Department of Chemistry

Chemical approaches to the synthesis of functional materials – the design of materials targeting important properties by ‘bottom-up’ processes that manipulate primary chemical bonds.

Fundamental chemistry principles involved in materials design through synthesis – process methodologies such as self-assembly, sol-gel reactions, synthesis of nanomaterials, etc.
