---
**Credits:** 3 (3-0-0)

#### Description
Modern methods applied in the synthesis of inorganic, organometallic and polymer materials. Handling of air and moisture sensitive compounds, dry box, glove bag, Schlenk line and vacuum line techniques. Methods of purification of and handling of reactive industrial gases. Methods of purification of inorganic compounds and crystallization of solids for X-ray analysis. General strategies, brief outline of theory and methodology used for the synthesis of inorganic/ organometallic molecules to materials including macromolecules. Emphasis will be placed how to adopt appropriate synthetic routes to control shape and size of the final product, ranging from amorphous materials, porous solids, thin films, large single crystals, and special forms of nanomaterials. A few examples of detailed synthesis will be highlighted in each category of materials.
