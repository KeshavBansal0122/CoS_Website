Applications of advanced 1D-NMR techniques such as nOe, 1D 13C-NMR (including APT and DEPT) techniques, multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, 2D NMR techniques (COSY, HETCOR, HSQC, HMBC, NOESY, ROESY etc.) for the structural and stereochemical determination of organic compounds. Introduction to various types of ionizations (such as EI, CI, MALDI, field ionization/desorption, electrospray ionization) and analyzers (such as quadrupole, time of flight, triple quadupole, QqTOF, ion-trap) in mass spectrometry for MS, MS/MS and MSn applications. Determination of peptide sequencing using mass spectrometric techniques.
