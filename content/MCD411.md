Department: Department of Mechanical Engineering

Prerequisites: EC 100

A broad outline of the contents is as follows and a project may include some or all of these activities:

Team formation for designing, manufacturing and operating a selected product, formulating project management procedures. Need identification, assessment of alternative designs, selection of design for development, defining design and performance specifications, and testing procedure. Detailed mechanical, thermal and manufacturing-related design of systems, assemblies, sub- assemblies and components culminating in engineering drawings and material specifications; preparing bill of materials and identification of standard components and bought-out parts.

Using engineering drawings, the process sheets are developed based on available materials, machine tools and other fabrication facilities. Materials and standard components are procured and manufacturing is carried out. After inspection, parts are accepted. Assembly procedure is finalized and the machine is assembled. Acceptance tests are carried out vis-Ã -vis specifications. Professional quality documentation of all designs, data, drawings, and results, change history, overall assessment, etc. is mandatory, along with a final presentation.
