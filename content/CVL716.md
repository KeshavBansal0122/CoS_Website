Theory: Stress-strain behaviour of rocks and rock masses: Elastic, elasto-plastic, and brittle, Crack phenomena and mechanisms of rock fracture.

Temperature, pressure and water related, problems, Effect of temperature on rock behaviour. Fluid flow through intact and fissured rocks.

Time dependent behaviour of rocks: Creep, Viscoelasticity and Viscoplasticity Continuum and discontinuum theories: Equivalent material, Block and Distinct element.

Application: Waste disposal, Radioactive and hazardous wastes, repositories, location and design, VLH, VDH and KBS3 concepts. Waste container, barriers, rock structure, embedment, buffers and seals. Performance assessment, quality control and monitoring. Case histories.

Earthquakes, tectonic stresses, creep, ground motions, damage, prediction. Volcanic activity and hazard. Tsunamis. Case studies.

Thermal analysis, Thermo-mechanical analysis, thermo-hydro- mechanical analysis. Rock dynamics. Physical modelling.
